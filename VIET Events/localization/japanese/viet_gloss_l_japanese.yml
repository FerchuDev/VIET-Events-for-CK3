 THIRTY_SIX_STRATEGEMS_GLOSS: "The #bold Thirty-Six Strategems#! is a classic text of military strategy from ancient China that lists thirty-six different strategies that could be applied to both military and political situations. Its origins are unknown, and it is possible these sayings were compiled over the years through oral tradition, before being written down. Though the first mention of the thirty-six strategies dates back to the Southern Qí Dynasty (487-537 CE), the modern version of the strategies dates back to a book that was first printed in 1941 which was a reprint of an earlier Míng or Qīng Dynasty."
 PEACHES_OF_IMMORTALITY_GLOSS: "In Chinese mythology and folklore, the #bold Peaches of Immortality#! are peaches that immortals eat to ensure everlasting life. Peaches are a common symbol of longevity in many East Asian countries, including but not limited to China."

 LIAOZHAI_ZHIYI_GLOSS: "#bold Liáozhāi Zhìyì#!, sometimes translated into English as #bold Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio#!, is a collection of hundreds of short stories by the Qīng Dynasty writer Pú Sōnglíng (1640-1715). They are considered the epitome of the so-called tales of the strange, a popular literary genre in East Asia that dealt with the supernatural, akin to the Gothic genre in Western literature. Pú Sōnglíng's supernatural stories include epic stories about revenge and history, grisly horror tales about ghosts, comical satires about society and the government, heartfelt romances, even simpler, almost brief, news-like accounts of unusual phenomena, and more. His stories were a great influence on later Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese literature, and remain popular in Asia to this day."
 FOX_SPIRIT_GLOSS: "The #bold fox spirit#! is a type of trickster spirit from East Asian mythology and fiction. They are known as #italic húlijīng#! in China, #italic yoho#! in Korean, #italic yōko#! in Japanese, and #italic ho ly tinh#! in Vietnamese. These shapeshifters often appear as beautiful women, but can take many different forms, such as an old man or a brawny soldier. They were believed to cause mischief, ranging from harmless pranks to, purportedly, death and the downfall of entire dynasties. Their portrayal as negative or more ambigious varied from country to country, era to era, and story to story, but in some tales, they were depicted sympathetically as benevolent (if mischievous) helpers or caring, loving spouses and romantic partners."
