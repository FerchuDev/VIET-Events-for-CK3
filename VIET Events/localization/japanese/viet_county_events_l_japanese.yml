 VIETmisc.3000.desc:0 "Certain kinds of edible berries from [county.GetNameNoTier] have gained a positive reputation around parts of the region for their supposed medicinal properties. They are being shipped out in greater numbers to neighboring areas as a result, bolstering the local economy."

 VIETmisc.3001.t:0 "A Fascinating Cave"
 VIETmisc.3001.desc:0 "A few days ago, herders discovered a small cave in [county.GetNameNoTier]. Inside, they found several trinkets that would otherwise be of little value, such as wooden utensils and a few carved stones. There were even fragments of bones from an unidentified creature.\n\nAlthough the cave does not have anything of note, it was clearly inhabited sometime ago, or at least used as a stopping point for travelers or nomads. Its discovery has caused quite a sensation, with several locals scouring it to see what little things they could find in it for amusement."
 VIETmisc.3001.a:0 "And how is this news of any consequence to me?"
 VIETmisc.3001.b:0 "Send servants to collect some trinkets for me too."
 VIETmisc.3001.c:0 "We should erect a small [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] shrine in the cave."
 VIETmisc.3002.t:0 "The Good Captain"
 VIETmisc.3002.desc:0 "A garrison captain of a major fort in [county.GetNameNoTier], named [captain.GetFullName], has gained the admiration of many for [captain.GetHerHis] kind and righteous nature. For instance, [captain.GetSheHe] disciplines [captain.GetHerHis] men to be polite and helpful to the locals, and harshly punishes any guards who use their station to bully others, yet this inspires even more loyalty in [captain.GetHerHis] impressed underlings than resentment. Furthermore, [captain.GetSheHe] has done much work defeating several bandit gangs in the area, and is rumored to even have the grudging respect of these ruffians for being a worthy opponent.\n\nI am considering bringing [captain.GetHerHim] to my court - a charismatic, upstanding soldier like that could be of great use, helping whip some of my forces into shape. On the other hand, maybe I should let [captain.GetHerHim] keep [captain.GetHerHis] current post, as [captain.GetSheHe] is doing a good job there."
 VIETmisc.3002.a:0 "I need a soldier like that in my employ. Invite [captain.GetHerHim] to my court!"
 VIETmisc.3002.b:0 "The people need [captain.GetHerHim] more. Let [captain.GetHerHim] stay there."
 VIETmisc.3002.c:0 "Grant [county.GetNameNoTier] to [captain.GetHerHim] - a good [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] will lead the community well."
 VIETmisc.3003.t:0 "The Rogues"
 VIETmisc.3003.desc:0 "Alarming news from [county.GetNameNoTier]! A small group of bandits have been going around posing as my soldiers to take people's money and possessions.\n\nThe odd thing is, they don't use the usual crude intimidation methods one would expect from a typical bandit. Instead, they pretend to be agents sent on important missions to secure peace in the region but need aid from the locals. Targeting the elderly, gullible, and moronic, they con them of their wealth without much coercion. Their operations went undetected for some time precisely because they did not usually physically harm others, and some of their victims were too embarrassed to admit what happened."
 VIETmisc.3003.a:0 "I'll let the local officials decide how to handle them."
 VIETmisc.3003.b:0 "Brutes or not, they're still criminals - arrest them!"
 VIETmisc.3003.c:0 "Intriguing. Are they willing to work for me? They seem useful."
 VIETmisc.3004.t:0 "The Doorway"
 VIETmisc.3004.desc:0 "Weeks ago, a most bizarre stone structure was found in the wilderness of [county.GetNameNoTier]. Those who saw it claim that this structure is shaped somewhat like some kind of gate.\n\nI sent a couple officials to investigate the situation, and in their report, they confirmed that indeed, this large stone - as high as a tall man - resembles the arch of a door. Some peasants had tried to move the stone previously to make use of its material in local construction projects, but the stone would not budge. Furthermore, some people now believe that it might be a portal to another realm - whether a fearsome one full of demons and other horrors, or some heavenly paradise, they do not know, but there is growing apprehension in the community."
 VIETmisc.3004.a:0 "Big stones lie around all over the place. Leave it be for now."
 VIETmisc.3004.b:0 "To put people at ease, assign some local guards to be there."
 VIETmisc.3005.t:0 "Boiling Point"
 VIETmisc.3005.desc:0 "A town in [county.GetNameNoTier] is the recent scene of some unfortunate happenings. There has been heated debate about a local issue in one larger town that is too irrelevant for my attention, but it was contentious enough that two people present at a recent meeting of various notables came to blows over it. A brawl eventually broke out, causing a great scene, and resulting in many injuries.\n\nTensions are reaching a boiling point in the town, and it may be necessary for me to intervene as the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName] who has supreme jurisdiction over the area."
 VIETmisc.3005.a:0 "The issue is irrelevant to begin with, so it's not worth my time."
 VIETmisc.3005.b:0 "I'll attempt to mediate some negotiations between both sides."

 VIETmisc.3006.t:0 "Fiery"
 VIETmisc.3006.desc:0 "A major fire recently swept through a large town in [county.GetNameNoTier]. It has nevertheless devastated much of the settlement, and left many dead or injured. Given the town was of regional importance, this disaster could have long-time consequences."
 VIETmisc.3006.a:0 "Do what we can to aid the survivors and help rebuild."
 VIETmisc.3006.b:0 "I'm sure the commoners will figure out how to endure."
 VIETmisc.3007.t:0 "The Zone of Death"
 VIETmisc.3007.desc:0 "An area in [county.GetNameNoTier] that lies between two small villages, and is half a day's journey from one end to the other, has been notoriously known in local folklore as the "zone of death," among other unflattering names. It is said that there are dark energies in this area that cause many unfortunate incidents. For instance, there are stories of unwary travelers passing through who drink the water or eat the food from there, only to be cursed with sicknesses unrecognizable to our doctors that cause them to die weeks later.\n\nMany of us outsiders have paid little heed to such stories, as there are plenty of mysterious and dangerous places around the world, after all. But the rumors are now spreading, and even some merchants from afar avoid that area."
 VIETmisc.3007.a:0 "I should make sure to avoid traveling there myself."
 VIETmisc.3007.b:0 "I question whether it's really cursed, but who knows?"
 VIETmisc.3008.t:0 "The Mysterious Relic"
 VIETmisc.3008.desc:0 "I've received a strange report from one of my officials stationed in a village in a distant corner of [county.GetNameNoTier]. Several weeks ago, loud noises were reported one night; it sounded like blacksmiths at work, or carpenters building houses, yet no such activity was being done, to anyone's knowledge.\n\nThat morning, my official went with the locals to investigate the source of the noise; all they saw were a few fallen trees and odd clumps of dirt on the ground… and a rod made of some kind of wood. When touched, it emitted a loud sound that temporarily deafened all who were present, and a great light appeared for a brief moment. No one has been able to make the rod do that again, despite repeated efforts.\n\nThe peasants believe that the rod a holy relic from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName], but my official, a scholar, is more skeptical, as the report concludes: "I have no doubt [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName] would never leave divine artifacts lying around like trash. After all, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorSheHe] would surely prefer we study and learn from this strange thing to further our knowledge of natural phenomena about the world [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorSheHe] created.""
 VIETmisc.3008.a:0 "The peasants will be happy if we consecrate the holy relic."
 VIETmisc.3008.b:0 "It would be a worthy endeavor to let local scholars study it!"
 VIETmisc.3009.t:0 "Missing Persons in [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.3009.desc:0 "Commoners living in [county.GetNameNoTier] stumbled on something strange not too long ago: an entire trading caravan. That is, the caravan itself was fine - the pack animals, trade goods, food and supplies, and so on were there, but the people of that caravan were not. The caravan members - merchants, porters, mercenary escorts, camp followers, and so on - were last seen leaving one of the nearby villages several weeks beforehand, so they couldn't have traveled far.\n\nWhen several of my guards and officials living searched for the missing persons, no other traces of them could be found. How did they just vanish all of a sudden like that? There are theories blaming everything from bandits to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName], but we do need to figure out what to do with the goods and animals just sitting around doing nothing."
 VIETmisc.3009.a:0 "Just give the leftover supplies to some locals."
 VIETmisc.3009.b:0 "Sell the supplies to whatever merchants you find."
 VIETmisc.3010.t:0 "Lovely Pottery"
 VIETmisc.3010.desc:0 "Ceramics made in [county.GetNameNoTier] have recently become something of a fad in other lands, and they are selling for higher prices. A number of merchants have flocked to the area to expand their business opportunities there, and this is helping the local economy boom."
 VIETmisc.3010.a:0 "Great to hear!"
 VIETmisc.3011.t:0 "Casting a Shadow Over [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.3011.desc:0 "A dark cloud was seen hovering around [county.GetNameNoTier] recently in a manner that locals described as unnatural and bizarre. It stayed in one exact spot for days on end (so they claim), casting an unwelcome shadow near one village in particular. Though the cloud has since dispersed, some claim the presence of such an omen spells doom and gloom for us, and dark times are soon to come, but I am not so sure how valid such claims are."
 VIETmisc.3011.a:0 "I'll pray to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to guide us in these troubled times."
 VIETmisc.3011.b:0 "I'm sure it is nothing at all and just a strange cloud…."
 VIETmisc.3012.t:0 "Bad Officers"
 VIETmisc.3012.desc:0 "I have been receiving an increasing amount of reports about the brutality of my military officers who lead troops stationed in [county.GetNameNoTier]. While they generally do not terrorize the populace, they do not treat the troops serving under them very well. I have heard that it's gotten bad enough that some of the grunts claim they would rather serve under [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName] than their commanders, as [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilSheHe] would surely be more merciful! As a result, desertions are widespread and the morale of the remaining soldiers are low.\n\nI could bring in new commanders. However, it might be politically awkward, given some of the current commanders have connections elsewhere and are of some social standing and influence, so they might cause some ruckus if removed from their positions."
 VIETmisc.3012.a:0 "This is not an issue I have time to worry about, alas."
 VIETmisc.3012.b:0 "Replace some commanders if possible. The politics of it is irrelevant."
 VIETmisc.3013.t:0 "Not in Vain"
 VIETmisc.3013.desc:0 "A bandit cartel had been terrorizing [county.GetNameNoTier] for a while now, and my forces stationed there have had trouble countering them effectively. Recently, one of the guard captains there was even assassinated by a spy working for these criminals. It was meant to be a major blow to my troops, given this captain's charisma, diligence, good relations with the local community. Yet, this had the opposite effect than what the bandits intended.\n\nThe assassinated commander, beloved by many, has become a martyr. Thus, my troops and other local commoners, spurred on by bloodlust to avenge the captain, redoubled their efforts to crush the bandit gang. Scores of bandits have been killed in the past few weeks, including many of their leaders, and their influence is greatly reduced, perhaps permanently. There were even rumors that the spirit of the commander assisted them from the afterlife."
 VIETmisc.3013.a:0 "It's bittersweet, but at least the bandits are defeated."
 VIETmisc.3013.b:0 "I will honor the commander with a monument."
 VIETmisc.3014.t:0 "The Legendary Mound of [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.3014.desc:0 "For centuries, a small hill in [county.GetNameNoTier] was long believed to be some kind of burial mound or the final resting place of a long-gone, legendary figure. Who this figure was, how they got buried there, varies greatly depending on who you ask. Some say it is the tomb of a great warrior who died defending their hometown against a monster or invading horde. Others say it is one of a holy man or woman who performed miracles. Yet others claim it is one for a revered ancestral monarch who was a just ruler.\n\nRegardless of who it was (if someone is even buried there), [mound_tourist.GetTitledFirstName] has recently taken an interest in this hill after visiting it. Now, [mound_tourist.GetSheHe] has suggested that I spend some funds to erect a small shrine on the hill, where locals can pay their respects. The question is, who do #italic I#! think is buried there and would they deserve such an honor?"
 VIETmisc.3014.a:0 "It's pointless. We don't know who's buried there or if there's even a tomb!"
 VIETmisc.3014.b:0 "A warrior must be buried there. A shrine will inspire the local garrison."
 VIETmisc.3014.c:0 "A [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] must be buried there. A shrine will honor them and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."

 VIETmisc.3015.b:0 "We should take steps to curb their excesses."

 VIETmisc.3019.desc:0 "There is a rather (in)famous courtesan named [hooker.GetFullName], who has settled down in [county.GetNameNoTier] where she plies her trade, so to speak. She is famous even in foreign lands for her talents and beauty, and it has helped enhance the mystique of [county.GetNameNoTier] to potential travelers.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet her when I visited the town she was staying at on some official business, as she was invited (by the host himself) to a feast I attended there. I must admit, she is a charming lady."
 VIETmisc.3019.a:0 "She is a cultured courtesan, after all, and not some random harlot."
 VIETmisc.3019.b:0 "I would pay for a memorable night with her if she's willing."

Currently, [traveler.GetSheHe] is serving the community as an important leader in one of the major towns. Today, [traveler.GetSheHe] is visiting my court, and based on our discussions so far, it appears [traveler.GetSheHe] retains a lot of knowledge about the various lands [traveler.GetSheHe] traveled in, and [traveler.GetSheHe] hopes to use it to assist [traveler.GetHerHis] town in growing and developing."

 VIETmisc.3022.desc:0 "There are rumors that a commoner girl from [county.GetNameNoTier] is said to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. She has many suitors, including men of very high status! Yet, if the rumors I've heard are to be trusted, she says she will one day marry a man who truly loves her, and her parents seem fine with indulging in her idealistic notions. At any rate, the fact that even a few suitors are wealthy and powerful men from afar has, amusingly enough, given the local economy a slight boost as they've been spending copious amounts of money locally."
 VIETmisc.3022.a:0 "That's nice to hear. I hope she'll find a good husband."
 VIETmisc.3022.b:0 "Sounds like silly gossip, so it's nothing I care about."

The father is a craftsman and the mother a [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('lowly_servant_type')], and they make enough to afford the family a humble but comfortable life. Upon meeting the girl, named [beauty.GetFullName], I am shocked.\n\nTo say she is hideous is an absolute understatement. Upon further inquiry, I learned that the stories of her beauty were cruel rumors created by some bored local bullies, which spiraled out of control. Her family has been trying to put an end to such gossip, to no avail."
 VIETmisc.3023.desc.unpleasant:0 "\n\nThe girl is not much of a pleasant person. Years of being bullied by others for her looks, it seemed, has made her bitter, though I have to admit I find her self-deprecating humor amusing.

 VIETmisc.3025.desc:0 "While on patrol in the wilderness of [county.GetNameNoTier], a couple of my soldiers discovered a small wayside shrine. What is odd about it, however, is that it is mostly submerged under one of the lakes in that region. My soldiers deigned it prudent to question some of the locals about this landmark, and they said it had always been there all these years. They had assumed it was a shrine of some sort to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] built by people who lived here generations ago that was abandoned once the waters of the lake got too high.\n\nAt any rate, I wonder if we might want to do a little engineering project, and move the shrine from its current location back onto land.

The only other thing of note in that spot were two trees by the tower, and a small, rotting wooden chest with nothing inside.\n\nIn the report I received, the local guard captain suggested we could renovate the tower to turn it into a watchpost, to assist with maintaining control over the region."

These three winters will be followed by great wars, and destruction and calamities of all kinds.\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier] has suffered three harsh winters in a row, and the peasants living in the area, so I’ve been told, are fearful that #italic Ragnarok#! is soon upon us. My [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] say there is no need for worry, since summers did happen between them, even if they were colder than usual, and no other signs of #italic Ragnarok#! are present.\n\nStill, there is worry among my court that there is a growing sense of hysteria among the locals."

This threesome of sorts was unnoticed for a while, until recently.\n\nSuch a ménage à trois is highly frowned upon in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName] as erotic deviancy, of course. Having a secret mistress is one thing, but to have two wives? The locals haven’t been happy with him for a while, and this is the final straw: they demand I take action, or they will do it themselves."

 VIETmisc.4017.a:0 "Who knows what mysterious forces are at play here?"
 VIETmisc.4018.t:0 "Famous Bard"
 VIETmisc.4018.desc:0 "A famous bard has settled down in [county.GetNameNoTier]. Though his music and singing is sublime, he refuses to perform for the wealthy and powerful, even when offered exorbitant amounts of riches. He even refused an invitation from me! Instead, he prefers to entertain the poor and the masses, inspiring and uplifting them."
 VIETmisc.4018.a:0 "He shall be arrested for his insolence!"
 VIETmisc.4018.b:0 "If he wishes to associate with commoners, so be it."
 VIETmisc.4018.c:0 "I can understand his reasons, to be honest."
 VIETmisc.4019.t:0 "The Floating Ship"
 VIETmisc.4019.desc:0 "Disturbing reports from  [county.GetNameNoTier]! A mysterious ship has been spotted floating in the sky along the far horizon in several areas by the coast. The few ships that tried to approach it could never reach it, and it does not fly the flag or banner of any known peoples or realms. Wherever it is spotted, locals report hearing strange, whistling noises, like a faint, screeching, wailing wind, in the night for several weeks afterwards."
 VIETmisc.4019.a:0 "Alarming apparitions...."
 VIETmisc.4019.b:0 "Maybe it's peasant hysteria?"
 VIETmisc.4020.t:0 "The Ancient Stone Monument"
 VIETmisc.4020.desc:0 "A peasant in [county.GetNameNoTier] got lost recently while trekking near the wilderness. She came across a flat, vertical stone surface where the ancient rulers of the region carved various images and symbols. After she reported this to the authorities, I sent in people to investigate and it appears this stone might be the last remnants of an imposing ancient monument! The stone can't be re-used, so it must stand where it is, perhaps for all eternity."
 VIETmisc.4020.a:0 "Quite a sight to behold, isn't it?"
 VIETmisc.4020.b:0 "This is a holy place - build an altar near it."
 VIETmisc.4020.c:0 "Send a few antiquarians to study it."
 VIETmisc.4020.tooltip:0 "For as long as any [county|E] in your [domain|E] has the [GetModifier('VIET_flat_stone_monument').GetNameWithTooltip] [county_modifier|E], you will have access to the [GetActivityType( 'activity_VIET_ancient_stone_monument_examination' ).GetName] [activity|E] to sate your own curiosity."

 VIETmisc.4021.a:0 "Troubling news. Sadly, there's not much we can do."
 VIETmisc.4021.b:0 "We should provide some aid and relief to the locals."
 VIETmisc.4022.t:0 "The Forlorn Watchman"
 VIETmisc.4022.desc:0 "Whispers of a ghost of [county.GetNameNoTier] have reached my court. Many sightings have been reported along the cliffs by several coastal villages, and the stories were mostly consistent with each other: every evening, the faint trace of the ghost appears and stands looking at the sea, gazing into the waters for a few hours before disappearing. The ghost is not malevolent at all, and when approached, merely points, in an almost dreamlike manner, towards something which no one can see nor understand, before disappearing. Furthermore, a few villagers even claimed that the ghost has silently guided wayward travelers to safety.\n\nAnyways, the ghost has been nicknamed the "Forlorn Watchman" by locals. Some question his existence, but who am I say to say if such sightings are genuine or not?"
 VIETmisc.4022.a:0 "What a ghost story!"
 VIETmisc.4023.t:0 "Pistachio Craze"
 VIETmisc.4023.desc:0 "Recently, pistachios from [county.GetNameNoTier] have become very popular in the region. It must be something related to their taste or texture. Exports will likely continue to grow in the coming years."

 VIETmisc.4024.t:0 "Landslide in [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.4024.desc:0 "A landslide has been reported in [county.GetNameNoTier], burying several villages and killing many. I'll need to act quickly if I am to help the people here."

 VIETmisc.4025.desc:0 "The current generation of young men from [county.GetNameNoTier] have won fame for their bravery and strength while serving in my armies and garrisons, and defending the locals against bandits."

 VIETmisc.4026.desc:0 "A village in [county.GetNameNoTier] has a giant tree that was planted many generations ago to provide shade for the villagers. It has been something of a popular site for people to visit. [tree_lover.GetTitledFirstName] has visited it several times, and suggested that I could donate some funds to assist in caring for the tree."
 VIETmisc.4026.a:0 "A good idea! Let's send them the funds."
 VIETmisc.4026.b:0 "I think they should be fine without our help."
 VIETmisc.4026.tooltip:0 "For as long as any [county|E] in your [domain|E] has the [GetModifier('VIET_giant_shade_tree').GetNameWithTooltip] [county_modifier|E], you will have access to the [GetActivityType( 'activity_VIET_giant_shade_tree_visit' ).GetName] [activity|E]."

 VIETmisc.4027.desc:0 "Locals from [county.GetNameNoTier] have reported most unusual and concerning incidents. Several sources have claimed that they have seen otherworldly shadows, vaguely in the shape of people, going around attempting to kill unsuspecting innocents. The common thread here is that the shadows tend to appear at night as people are falling asleep or waking up. Reputable scholars and [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] believe this is nothing but hysteria."
 VIETmisc.4027.a:0 "Troubling times we live in."
 VIETmisc.4027.b:0 "Send in [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] to pray. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] preserve us!"
 VIETmisc.4027.c:0 "The scholars are right. It's just hysteria."
 VIETmisc.4028.t:0 "The Supposed Forces of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]"
 VIETmisc.4028.desc:0 "In the past few months, a town in [county.GetNameNoTier] suffered from quite a scare. Townspeople heard strange, inhuman sounds at night, and feared [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName] was up to something. Prayers were offered, nightly patrols were increased, and so on.\n\nHowever, by chance, it has eventually discovered that the source of all this ruckus were several crafty youths who, with nothing better to do, pranked the town at everyone else's expense. The boys are under arrest and their fate is now in my hands."
 VIETmisc.4028.a:0 "No harm done, let them go."
 VIETmisc.4028.b:0 "They will be subject to public humiliation."

 VIETmisc.4031.desc:0 "On a visit to a village of my realm, in [county.GetNameNoTier], I am talking with a guardsman stationed there. He looks around, eyes fearful, as he tells me: "If you have to travel in these parts, by [county.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetFaith.HighGodName] stay on the roads. The wilderness just isn't safe anymore. We've had sightings, you see... the demons.""
 VIETmisc.4031.a:0 "If demons are about, they're no match for brave men like you."
 VIETmisc.4031.b:0 "Hah! That's just paranoia. Demons here? That's ridiculous."
 VIETmisc.4031.c:0 "Perhaps we should increase patrols and bring in holy men from elsewhere."
 VIETmisc.4032.t:0 "The Ancient Fort's Treasure"
 VIETmisc.4032.desc:0 "While traveling in [county.GetNameNoTier], my entourage and I came across a ruined stone structure that resembled an ancient fort. Feeling adventurous, we explored it a bit given it wasn't that huge. While there, we found a chest filled with some gold trinkets and jewelry."
 VIETmisc.4032.a:0 "Finders keepers! It's ours now!"
 VIETmisc.4032.b:0 "We should not take what belongs to the dead of this place."

 VIETmisc.4033.a:0 "Fascinating!"
 VIETmisc.4034.t:0 "Noises at Night"
 VIETmisc.4034.desc:0 "Eerie, loud noises were heard at night in some of the nearby villages in [county.GetNameNoTier] not too long ago. They were sometimes accompanied by strange colors in the sky. Investigation by my officials and soldiers could not determine as to what was the cause."
 VIETmisc.4034.a:0 "Frightening!"
 VIETmisc.4035.t:0 "The Mysterious Conman"
 VIETmisc.4035.desc:0 "In [county.GetNameNoTier], stories have spread of a conman who sells "charms" to unsuspecting children. Some have said that these charms are actually real, with verifiable effects, others claim they are fake, and do nothing. Some say the charms are fake but that they are as effective if not more than real charms, and yet others believe the opposite.\n\nRegardless, the conman seems to have mysteriously left for other lands."
 VIETmisc.4035.a:0 "I wonder whether he was a real conman, or a fake one."

 VIETmisc.4036.desc:0 "There are rumors that certain tax collectors in [county.GetNameNoTier] are disgustingly corrupt.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have any good evidence to back this up. In fact, after a lengthy investigation, it seems like these officials actually do a good job and behave more honorably than some of my other officials elsewhere.\n\nStill, many people in the region are not convinced otherwise. If I don't do something, the locals might grow restless, but on the other hand, imprisoning good officials without cause would be problematic as well."
 VIETmisc.4036.a:0 "Innocent or not, arrest these officials!"
 VIETmisc.4036.b:0 "I won't bow down to the demands of ignorant peasants."

 VIETmisc.4037.desc:0 "Reports of a most heinous and unforgivable crime has come from a village in [county.GetNameNoTier]!\n\nTwo siblings - a brother and a sister - lusted after one another. Quite unnatural and shameful indeed! The two siblings were caught in the middle of intercourse recently, and had to flee elsewhere to avoid the wrath of their family and the villagers. The depraved couple are now believed to be in some foreign land, where no one knows who they are.\n\nStill, that such a thing happened has caused much commotion. To think that right under our noses all this time, there lived these degenerate, disgusting villains, no better than murderers and cannibals and other horrid beasts, who deserve nothing but the harshest and most torturous deaths for their vile acts!"
 VIETmisc.4037.a:0 "Disgusting. I feel dirty just by hearing that."
