 VIETmisc.6000.t:0 "A Public Debate"
 VIETmisc.6000.desc:0 "Two intellectuals named [intellectual_1.GetFirstName] and [intellectual_2.GetFirstName] have arrived at my court. We were looking forward to this occasion, as they are prominent in local circles for their wildly divergent but interesting interpretations of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText], and other theological matters. They are bitter rivals, and seek to prove the other wrong in a public debate; I and the rest of my court would be spectators.\n\n[intellectual_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is known as a staunch traditionalist, who defends the classical understandings of our faith. [intellectual_2.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], by contrast, is a maverick and rebel; though [intellectual_2.GetSheHe] does not hold any heretical views, it’s clear [intellectual_2.GetSheHe] has rather innovative interpretations of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] theology.\n\nIn their lively discussion, both scholars proved quite adept at arguing, counter-arguing, counter-counter-arguing, and so on. My courtiers mostly agree neither side had the upper hand in the debate, so everyone looks to me to officially declare who won."
 VIETmisc.6000.desc.traditionalist:0 "\n\nMy [chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] [chaplain.GetTitledFirstName] appears to support [intellectual_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], as [chaplain.GetSheHe] tells me, “[intellectual_1.GetSheHe|U] defended the orthodox understanding of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName]. [intellectual_2.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is no heretic, but skirts too close to heresy for comfort.”"
 VIETmisc.6000.desc.innovator:0 "\n\nMy [chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] [chaplain.GetTitledFirstName] appears to support [intellectual_2.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], as [chaplain.GetSheHe] tells me, “[intellectual_2.GetSheHe|U] proves we can always find new ways to approach [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] theology. [intellectual_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], I’m afraid to say, blindly adheres to tradition, instead of considering what [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] wants us to do.”"
 VIETmisc.6000.a:0 "[intellectual_1.GetFirstName] made the better arguments in defending orthodox ideas."

 VIETmisc.6001.t:0 "The Robber Baron"
 VIETmisc.6001.desc:0 "In the last few months, I’ve heard of a robber baron named [bandit.GetFullName] operating in [county.GetNameNoTier]. This cretin is a petty noble who wished to defy #italic my#! royal authority by imposing extra tolls on people traveling through [bandit.GetHerHis] fief, beyond that which is rightfully due to [bandit.GetHerHim], giving travelers an ultimatum to either pay the extra toll or else be robbed or kidnapped for ransom forcibly.\n\nAnyways, this slippery criminal somehow evaded capture for some time… until now. By chance, my officials have apprehended [bandit.GetHerHim], and [bandit.GetSheHe] has been brought to me for judgment. Engaging in such acts without my authority is a stain on my reputation, so [bandit.GetSheHe] must be punished accordingly."
 VIETmisc.6001.a:0 "A small fine will suffice and teach [bandit.GetHerHim] a lesson!"
 VIETmisc.6001.b:0 "In exchange for clemency, [bandit.GetSheHe] can work for me."
 VIETmisc.6001.c:0 "The law is clear. Death will be this criminal's fate!"
 VIETmisc.6001.d:0 "Strip [bandit.GetHerHim] of [bandit.GetHerHis] titles and rank."
 VIETmisc.6001.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Robber barons is a general term in English used to describe the phenomenon of medieval landholders and nobles who took advantage of their status and resources to levy high taxes and tolls on travelers and merchants, without legal authorization from higher authorities, particularly in times where centralized, royal control was weakened. For example, Louis VI of France spent many years dealing with robber barons in the early 1100s. These notorious figures would later give rise to the 19th century American slang term for unscrupulous, wealthy businessmen."

 VIETmisc.6002.t:0 "Unacceptable Behavior"
 VIETmisc.6002.desc:0 "Lately, [relative.GetTitledFirstName] has gained notoriety due to [relative.GetHerHis] poor behavior at my court. [relative.GetSheHe|U] forgets basic etiquette, has insulted more than one visiting envoy on occasion, and, overall, often disregards court protocol. Many suspect that because [relative.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is related to me, [relative.GetSheHe] believes [relative.GetSheHe] can get away with such lack of manners and propriety.\n\nThings have gotten bad enough that [complainer.GetTitledFirstName] has approached me to discuss this issue.\n\n“My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], you ought to do something about [relative.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] unacceptable conduct,” [complainer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] beseeches me. “Not only is it bad in and of itself, but it reflects poorly on #italic you#!.

 VIETmisc.6003.t:0 "A Blunder"
 VIETmisc.6003.desc:0 "Rituals are an important part of daily life in any royal court. They may be boring for some, but we must perform them regularly to emphasize my court’s power and status.\n\nWhy, then, did [courtier.GetTitledFirstName] slip up today? It was just a run of the mill ceremony for when I entered the court room in the morning, and everyone present had their part to play - certain gestures to make, certain body postures to assume, certain formulaic words to say, and so on. Yet [courtier.GetSheHe] blunder caused the ceremony to come to a screeching halt, even though [courtier.GetSheHe] has done this so many times before.\n\nAs I pass by [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], everyone gazes at the unfortunate [courtier.GetWomanMan], who has an embarrassed look on [courtier.GetHerHis] face. Regardless of my personal feelings, it does not reflect well on me as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] if even one member of my court cannot perform their basic duties."
 VIETmisc.6003.a:0 "It’s not a big deal at all! Mistakes happen all the time."
 VIETmisc.6003.b:0 "I’ll chastise [courtier.GetHerHim] in front of everyone."
 VIETmisc.6003.c:0 "I’ll privately chastise [courtier.GetHerHim]."
 VIETmisc.6004.t:0 "A Disapproving Envoy"
 VIETmisc.6004.desc:0 "[envoy.GetTitledFirstName], an official serving [neighbor.GetTitledFirstName], was sent by [envoy.GetHerHis] liege to visit my court, as part of some diplomatic formalities. After I graciously accepted this [envoy.GetWomanMan] into my court, while we were discussing various matters, [envoy.GetSheHe] had the nerve to suggest that my court is not up to par. What slander!\n\nIn particular, [envoy.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] said, “I would have expected the court of a great [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] such as yourself to be… grander. This is a rather small and dimly-lit room, the decorations are banal and dreary, and the stairs in that other room - everyone knows a good court needs excellent, majestic stairs!”\n\n[envoy.GetSheHe|U] sighs, then continues blabbering, “Look, to be frank, this ‘royal court’ isn’t that different from the court of a mere duke or petty chief. Where is the grandeur? The awe-inspiring majesty?”"
 VIETmisc.6004.a:0 "[envoy.GetSheHe|U] is tactless, but it might not hurt to spruce things up."
 VIETmisc.6004.b:0 "Send this disrespectful miscreant back to [neighbor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 VIETmisc.6004.c:0 "Let’s stick to more important topics like state affairs."
 VIETmisc.6005.t:0 "Frivolous Ceremonies"
 VIETmisc.6005.desc:0 "Rituals are an important part of the day to day proceedings of any royal court. A self-respecting monarch needs to maintain a sense of grandeur, and such rituals are an effective way to do that.\n\nHowever, a few of my courtiers have told me that several of the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] ceremonies regularly done at my court are perhaps a tad excessive, and a waste of money.\n\n[courtier.GetTitledFirstName] is foremost among my courtiers advocating for a reduction in the number of ceremonies, particularly the more fanciful ones. “Think of all the money we no longer have to spend on these frivolities!” [courtier.GetSheHe] explains to me, one day. “That money can then be spent on something actually useful.”"
 VIETmisc.6005.a:0 "Excellent point. I will implement your suggestions."
 VIETmisc.6005.b:0 "Oh, I’ve a better idea: I’ll #italic increase#! the number of rituals!"
 VIETmisc.6005.c:0 "I understand your point, but these rituals are important."
 VIETmisc.6006.t:0 "A Child's Blunder"
 VIETmisc.6006.desc:0 "Although [child.GetFirstName] is a child, it is important that [child.GetSheHe] observes the day to day business of my court as part of [child.GetHerHis] education. That way, when [child.GetSheHe] is an adult, [child.GetSheHe] will know how to properly behave no matter whose court [child.GetSheHe] is in.\n\nHowever, today, it appears [child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] made a blunder: [child.GetSheHe] forgot the proper etiquette when addressing [nice_courtier.GetTitledFirstName]! [nice_courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] laughed it off, saying [child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is just a child who will learn from this mistake, but [mean_courtier.GetFirstName], who witnessed the whole incident, said it was highly inappropriate, and that I need to discipline [child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and teach [child.GetHerHim] a lesson to maintain decorum in my court."
 VIETmisc.6006.a:0 "If [nice_courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] doesn’t mind, then I won’t mind either."
 VIETmisc.6006.b:0 "[mean_courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is right. I will chastise [child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] for this."
 VIETmisc.6006.c:0 "I think [child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has already learned what [child.GetSheHe] did wrong."
 VIETmisc.6007.t:0 "Distracting Servant"
 VIETmisc.6007.desc:0 "I have a servant named [servant.GetFirstName] who sometimes has to perform various duties in my court room to assist in its daily business. The thing is, [servant.GetSheHe] is exceedingly attractive. How is it that a commoner can look this attractive, even without proper cosmetics and good clothes?\n\nActually, if I want to be more correct, I wouldn’t say [servant.GetSheHe] is just exceedingly attractive, [servant.GetSheHe] is also #italic distractingly#! attractive. [courtier.GetTitledFirstName] has told me recently [courtier.GetSheHe] believes [servant.GetFirstNamePossessive] good looks interfere with my courtiers and servants’ ability to perform their duties.\n\n“How can anyone do anything when that… that lowly [servant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is over there,” [courtier.GetSheHe] told me, “agitating and tempting us with [servant.GetHerHis] stunningly agreeable appearance?”"
 VIETmisc.6007.a:0 "Fine. [servant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will be given other duties away from the court."
 VIETmisc.6007.b:0 "Someone this attractive should be elevated in rank instead!"
 VIETmisc.6007.c:0 "You know, I feel this is your problem, not anyone else’s."
 VIETmisc.6008.t:0 "Dozing Off"
 VIETmisc.6008.desc:0 "Today, we were partaking in some court ceremonies. It was just the bog standard rituals of nice words and clothing and gestures used to reinforce my power and status as a monarch.\n\nThese rituals are also awfully boring.\n\nIn fact, today’s ceremonies were so boring, I dozed off for what must have been a few minutes.\n\nI only woke up because [random_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] did a fake cough that was so loud that I heard it. Anyways, it was obvious everyone saw that I had fallen asleep, but they all pretended that nothing happened out of fear of offending me."
 VIETmisc.6008.a:0 "Everyone, I made a mistake. Don’t be like me."
 VIETmisc.6008.b:0 "I did wrong, but I shouldn’t attract attention to it."
 VIETmisc.6008.c:0 "Um… yes… nothing happened at all… where were we?"
 VIETmisc.6009.t:0 "Where are the Stairs?"
 VIETmisc.6009.desc:0 "Today my court is hosting a famous noble and traveler named [traveler.GetFullName] from [county.GetNameNoTier]. During [traveler.GetHerHis] visit, I ask [traveler.GetHerHim] how my royal court room compares to others [traveler.GetSheHe] has seen in [traveler.GetHerHis] travels.\n\n“You can be frank if you wish,” I reassure [traveler.GetHerHim]. “I want to see if there are any improvements I can make.”\n\n“My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I think your court room is fine,” [traveler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] says, “except for one thing: it lacks good stairs! These days, in other royal courts, grandiose stairs are #italic nowhere#! to be found. Strange, isn’t it?”\n\n“I never noticed until now, but your observations are correct!” I agree.\n\n“Exactly! Everyone knows large, majestic stairs can really make a building’s interior look much better,” [traveler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] says. “If you had some really nice big stairs here, or maybe there, or maybe in that other room, it would show how [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] is a #italic step above#! all the other monarchs.”"
 VIETmisc.6009.a:0 "A wonderful idea! I’ll build more stairs in that other room."
 VIETmisc.6009.b:0 "On the other hand... do we really need more stairs?"
 VIETmisc.6010.t:0 "Minor Renovations"
 VIETmisc.6010.desc:0 "I had some minor renovations done to my court room that were finished yesterday. As a monarch, I have a steady stream of people coming in and out of this room every day, and this does cause a noticeable amount of wear and tear. Thus, it is important that I maintain this place to look acceptable.\n\nThat said, the most recent renovations appear to have left some debris in the court room. My servants are hard at work trying to clear it up, which could take a day or two, but it does make my royal court look a little… undignified."
 VIETmisc.6010.a:0 "I’ll have to hold court elsewhere this week."
 VIETmisc.6010.b:0 "Hurry up! Clean the mess up quickly or else!"
 VIETmisc.6011.t:0 "Nagging [parent.GetMotherFather|U]"
 VIETmisc.6011.desc:0 "I was just performing the average duties an average [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like myself would do on an average day.\n\nUnfortunately, things were not as quiet and peaceful as I had hoped. After the morning ceremonies, my [parent.GetMotherFather], [parent.GetTitledFirstName], pulled aside a number of courtiers to chastise them for improper chatter or behavior, or how their clothing was a little off, or why they need to try harder in their work.\n\nWhen I tried to calm [parent.GetHerHim] down, my [parent.GetMotherFather] glared and said, while wagging a finger at me, “[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]! What kind of court are you running? You need to take responsibility for any lack of decorum here. You are a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] now, yet I still have to go around doing everything for you like you were a child!”\n\nAfter a long, awkward silence, [parent.GetSheHe] added in a sweet tone, “By the way, if you’re hungry, I asked the cook to prepare you some of your favorite treats earlier.  You look so haggard these days, you need to eat more!”"
 VIETmisc.6011.a:0 "[parent.GetMotherFather|U], stop it! I’m the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]!"
 VIETmisc.6011.b:0 "Ah! What would one do without one’s [parent.GetMotherFather]?"
 VIETmisc.6011.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Although we like to think of historical rulers as powerful figures with unlimited power, even the most powerful of them often had to defer to certain authority figures, especially their parents, and especially their mothers. It is said, for instance, that even the great Genghis Khan listened to his mother's advice."
 VIETmisc.6012.t:0 "Corrupt Official Caught!"
 VIETmisc.6012.desc:0 "Not too long ago, [courtier.GetTitledFirstName] was representing me on official business in a town in the [county.GetName]. While there, [courtier.GetSheHe] witnessed one of my petty officials, [official.GetFullName], harassing some peasants, physically pushing them around, trying to extort money from them, and making lecherous comments towards the more fetching of the commoners.\n\nAngered by this injustice, [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] approached [official.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], warning [official.GetHerHim] to stop. [official.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] scoffed at [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], assuming [courtier.GetSheHe] was a nobody, until [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] revealed [courtier.GetSheHe] was my direct representative.\n\nTo insult the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNamePossessiveNoTooltip] official representative is no laughing matter, and, due to the many complaints about [official.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] from the locals, [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has brought the fool to me for judgment. [courtier.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] logic is that if I punish [official.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] here, in my court, in front of everyone, I can set a firm example for the rest of my realm."
 VIETmisc.6012.a:0 "You learned your lesson, [official.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. Don’t do it again."
 VIETmisc.6012.b:0 "Strip [official.GetHerHim] of [official.GetHerHis] titles and imprison [official.GetHerHim]."
 VIETmisc.6012.c:0 "I’ll punish [official.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] #italic and#! reward [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 VIETmisc.6013.t:0 "An Impressed Guest"
 VIETmisc.6013.desc:0 "Several dignitaries from the [county.GetName] recently paid a visit to my court on behalf of the elites there. I spent a few weeks hosting these esteemed guests; we spent time discussing state affairs but also enjoying good feasts and pleasant pastimes.\n\nBefore they left, one of them, a gentle[dignitary.GetWomanMan] by the name of [dignitary.GetFullName], says [dignitary.GetSheHe] always wanted to travel to [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Having seen this area now, [dignitary.GetSheHe] was so impressed that [dignitary.GetSheHe] wishes to stay here and serve me as a courtier.\n\nHowever, [dignitary.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is also known in [dignitary.GetHerHis] homeland as a talented and capable community leader, who contributes much to society."
 VIETmisc.6013.a:0 "Your people need you. Achieve great things back home!"
 VIETmisc.6013.b:0 "If you want to join my court, I’ll gladly welcome you."
 VIETmisc.6014.t:0 "Shame!"
 VIETmisc.6014.desc:0 "“Shame on you!” [shamer.GetTitledFirstName] says. “#italic Shame on you!#! We are inside a royal court room! Your poor attitude and improper behavior drag this court down, giving our [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] a bad name among the monarchs of the world!”\n\nIt appears [shamer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is having a problem with several of my servants again. [shamer.GetSheHe|U] always has high expectations for them, especially when inside my court room; these expectations sometimes seem impossible to meet.\n\nMy servants timidly apologize to [shamer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] for their mishap (whether it was a real, actual mistake or not, I do not know), and it occurs to me that by engaging in this behavior, [shamer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] could be seen by some people as indirectly usurping #italic my#! authority to discipline and reprimand my own servants in this court room."
 VIETmisc.6014.a:0 "[shamer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has a right to scold them if [shamer.GetSheHe] thinks it’s needed."

 VIETmisc.6015.t:0 "Oh No!"
 VIETmisc.6015.desc:0 "I was in my court, doing the ordinary things that an ordinary [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] does on an ordinary day. It was getting dull, if I had to be honest. And then…\n\n#italic #bold BAM!#!#!\n\nEveryone turns around, shocked. What was that?\n\n[courtier.GetTitledFirstName] went to investigate the source of the commotion, and it turns out one of the large wall hangings dislodged itself and fell down, causing a very loud and disturbing noise. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but it was an awkward incident. One might even recall some [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] folk tales and superstitions about how misfortune for monarchs like myself is typically preceded by strange, seemingly random, and ominous incidents like this."

In the present era, however, peaches can be challenging to grow in these colder climates compared to the Mediterranean, so any who wish to eat the fruit must export it at high prices from Mediterranean markets.\n\nHowever, recently, local nobles and merchants have managed to successfully cultivate small numbers of peaches in [county.GetNameNoTier].\n\n[courtier.GetTitledFirstName] suggests I should support this burgeoning industry. As [courtier.GetSheHe] explains it, “Peaches are a symbol! They harken back to the glory days of the old Romans. Tying yourself to these fruits will show that you are a far-sighted [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] who wants to renew the Roman way of life in these lands.”"
 VIETmisc.6022.a:0 "It’s an unnecessarily ambitious waste of our resources."
 VIETmisc.6022.b:0 "Intriguing idea! Let’s support the peach growers."

 VIETmisc.6022.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Although peaches originated from Asia, they reached the Mediterranean by the heyday of the Roman Empire, where they were very popular, and spread throughout the empire. For instance, we have archaeological evidence showing how peaches spread to northern Europe during this time alongside the presence of the Roman army. However, following the collapse of the western Empire, peaches became rare again in these regions. They began seeing a revival during the Carolingian period, as the peach’s association with Roman prestige and imperial might led the Carolingians to encourage the spread of peaches (and other similar plants) as part of a “renewal” of Roman culture. In a sense, through asserting control over the environment, they, too, were asserting their political legitimacy and imperial ideology over the rest of Europe."
