 VIETold.0000.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETold.0001.t:0 "Night Sky"
 VIETold.0001.desc:0 "Tonight the night sky is clear, and you can see every single star shining in the sky like jewels on a fine, black dress. What wonder can be found in heaven"s creation! What magic! You have a rare moment of peace in yourself as you admire the night sky."
 VIETold.0001.a:0 "Amazing."
 VIETold.0002.t:0 "The Butterfly"
 VIETold.0002.desc:0 "A butterfly landed on my arm. It looks so harmless, just fluttering its wings, unaware of my existence."
 VIETold.0002.a:0 "I'll wait until it flies away."
 VIETold.0002.b:0 "Shake it off."
 VIETold.0002.c:0 "Smash and kill it!"
 VIETold.0003.t:0 "The Scorpion"
 VIETold.0003.desc:0 "I've just made a quick trip to one of the local oases. While resting with my entourage on the journey back, I fail to notice a scorpion nearby - I accidentally irritate it, and it stings me hard! My men quickly dispose of the creature while I squirm in pain."
 VIETold.0003.a:0 "Ow! Ow!"
 VIETold.0004.t:0 "Happy Dream"
 VIETold.0004.desc:0 "Night falls, and I quickly asleep as I rest in my bed. In my dreams, I see a great light, an impenetrable, heavenly light. I know not what it is, or even what it represents, but something about it brings me peace and happiness..."
 VIETold.0004.a:0 "Is it... a sign from the heavens?"
 VIETold.0005.t:0 "Field of Battle"
 VIETold.0005.desc:0 "The cries of fighting men, the splatter of red blood, the clashing of weapons everywhere... I scream and shout in my dream, unaware of my surroundings, of who is my friend and who is my enemy, swinging my sword without regard, lost in my battlerage and the hellish terror that is battle."
 VIETold.0005.a:0 "DIE! DIE!"
 VIETold.0006.t:0 "You Have Been Chosen"
 VIETold.0006.desc:0 "In my dream, I see a tall figure with a golden mask approach, coming closer, and closer, and closer... And then, I am suddenly awakened by my servant. "Wake Up. We're here. Are you ok? Wake up. Stand up. There you go. You were dreaming.""
 VIETold.0006.a:0 "What was that..."
 VIETold.0007.t:0 "The Roman Empire - Restored!"
 VIETold.0007.desc:0 "I stand before your people, basking in glory, arms outstretched.\n\n"Rome is restored!" I proclaim, to the cheers of the crowds.\n\nAnd just as it quickly started, the dream ended, and I wake up.\n\n"That was a good dream," I mutter to myself. "If only it were true...""
 VIETold.0007.a:0 "Long live Rome..."
 VIETold.0008.t:0 "Splash!"
 VIETold.0008.desc:0 "A big splash, and I fall into the mud. Dammit! If only it didn’t rain this morning. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to take a stroll outside, after all. I stand up, trying to wipe the mud off my ruined clothes."
 VIETold.0008.a:0 "Curses!"
 VIETold.0008.b:0 "'tis but the doing of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to humble me."
 VIETold.0009.t:0 "A Shiny Find"
 VIETold.0009.desc:0 "While strolling outside one day, I stop to relieve myself. As I finish, I notice a bit of gleaming on the ground. Careful to not step on my urine, I move towards the shiny object, and realize that it is a gold coin."
 VIETold.0009.a:0 "What luck!"
 VIETold.0010.t:0 "The Best Fertilizer?"
 VIETold.0010.desc:0 "Today I’m visiting some of the local peasants. Inquiring about their farming practices, one of the peasant men told me about how they are debating the usage of various fertilizers. “My lord, frankly, I’m not sure which one would help yield a better harvest - urine, feces, or dead plants.”"
 VIETold.0010.a:0 "Don’t talk such rot, you filthy peasant!"
 VIETold.0010.b:0 "Urine seems cleaner to me..."
 VIETold.0010.c:0 "Feces. It looks like dirt, maybe it’d work better with dirt?"
 VIETold.0010.d:0 "Dead plants make the most sense to me."
 VIETold.0011.t:0 "Manuscript Ink"
 VIETold.0011.desc:0 "I’m observing some of the local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] at work studying dense and arcane ancient texts. Suddenly, one of the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] says, “Oh dear, this manuscript won’t do at all. The colors of the illustrations aren’t good.”\n\nPerhaps I should suggest a better source of pigment to illustrate the manuscript."
 VIETold.0011.a:0 "Earwax, I’ve heard, makes the best pigment."
 VIETold.0011.b:0 "Many have told me urine really brings out the vibrant colors."
 VIETold.0011.c:0 "Try looking for colorful stones to grind, is what I've been told."
 VIETold.0011.a.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Earwax was useful as a binding medium when mixed with various powdered substances to create pigments."
 VIETold.0011.b.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Urine was often mixed with other materials to make certain kinds of colored pigments."
 VIETold.0011.c.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Colorful stones - particularly precious ones like lapis lazuli - have always been used as a source for colorful pigments."
 VIETold.0012.t:0 "The Colorful Stool"
 VIETold.0012.desc:0 "I overhear one of my courtiers complaining about how, as of late, their feces has turned strange colors, like green. Then again, this courtier is known for being a complete pig at times, so who knows what sort of foods caused this amusing circumstance?"
 VIETold.0012.a:0 "That's what you get for eating too much food!"
 VIETold.0012.b:0 "I suspect that you might have too much bile in your body."
 VIETold.0013.t:0 "Lazy Cook"
 VIETold.0013.desc:0 "Today, my personal cook prepared yet another meal by boiling the ingredients. Remembering the derisive Roman maxim, “The lazy cook prepares everything by boiling,” I decide I might as well ask my cook why he is so lazy. Trying to look intimidating as possible, I approach the cook and tell him..."
 VIETold.0013.a:0 "Don’t be lazy! If you work hard, everyone will appreciate it."
 VIETold.0013.b:0 "Some might care, but personally, I think it’s fine you’re being lazy."
 VIETold.0013.c:0 "Cook different foods! Maybe with garum or kefalintzin cheese?"
 VIETold.0013.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Garum was a fermented fish sauce that was first used among various civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean, including the Romans and Carthaginians, and it survived into the medieval period in Byzantine and Arab cuisine. Kefalintzin was a type of cheese reputedly eaten in the Byzantine Empire."
 VIETold.0014.t:0 "Vanity!"
 VIETold.0014.desc:0 "Today, a merchant from one of the eastern Mediterranean realms is visiting my household. To our utter shock, the man insisted that his servants cut the food up into pieces and then eating the pieces with this thing called a “fork”. These foreign manners are nothing but sheer vanity!"
 VIETold.0014.a:0 "Indeed! This is a mark of pride."
 VIETold.0014.b:0 "We should respect different customs, even if they are rather arrogant."
 VIETold.0014.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Although forks had been found in Europe (particularly the Roman Empire) since ancient times, the personal table fork only gained popularity in the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East during the early medieval period. The rest of Europe was slow to adopt the fork at first, seeing it as a symbol of excess and vanity, and in some places in Europe it wasn't even until the 18th century that personal forks became widespread."
 VIETold.0015.t:0 "Sour Kefir"
 VIETold.0015.desc:0 "It was supposed to be a delicious cup of kefir but it turned out to be too sour. It appears it wasn’t preserved that well, and now you’re feeling a bit sick."
 VIETold.0015.a:0 "Oh, my stomach’s revolting..."
 VIETold.0015.b:0 "I think someone’s trying to kill me!"
 VIETold.0015.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Kefir is a fermented milk drink and tastes somewhat like a thick liquid yogurt. It originated in the Caucasus region and later spread to neighboring cultures."
 VIETold.0016.t:0 "North African Mint Tea"
 VIETold.0016.desc:0 "Today, one of my vassals is visiting me. As custom dictates, I must prepare the traditional North African mint tea for my guest in a simple ceremony as a sign of my hospitality.\n\nThankfully, I manage to complete the ceremony with no blunders."
 VIETold.0016.a:0 "My vassal seems to appreciate it."
 VIETold.0017.t:0 "Nomad Pit Stop"
 VIETold.0017.desc:0 "While traveling to one of your faraway holdings, you must stop for a meal. You find a “guanz”, a ger or nomad tent used on the nomad steppes as a mobile restaurants as sorts. The owner of the guanz asks you what sort of meat would you like."
 VIETold.0017.a:0 "Horse meat, please."
 VIETold.0017.b:0 "Mutton is what I want."
 VIETold.0017.c:0 "Goat testicles sound good."
 VIETold.0017.d:0 "Dumplings filled with meat, onions, and garlic, yes!"
 VIETold.0017.e:0 "Barley porridge mixed with milk fat."

 VIETold.0018.t:0 "Bad Baklava"
 VIETold.0018.desc:0 "Oh! [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy on me, I should’ve never eaten that! It was definitely a bad idea buying that cheap baklava from the baklava merchant. It turned out to be really old and spoiled - no wonder he sold it at such a low price!"
 VIETold.0018.a:0 "I’m starting to feel really sick...."
 VIETold.0019.t:0 "Scammed"
 VIETold.0019.desc:0 "One of my close servants seems rather sullen lately, so I asked him if anything was wrong. He told me he recently was sent by my cook to buy a pig. He bought what he thought was a healthy piglet in a bag for a really low price. However, it turned out the bag contained not a piglet, but a cat."
 VIETold.0019.a:0 "Haha, that scam! Everyone knows about that one."
 VIETold.0019.b:0 "Tell me who did it. I’ll find and punish them!"
 VIETold.0019.c:0 "I also got deceived by that con several times myself."
 VIETold.0019.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the old days, there was a common scam where a conman would put a cat in a bag and pretend it was a piglet; they would then trick their victim into buying it without checking what it really was. It is also the origin of the idiom 'to let the cat out of the bag,' as the buyer would discover the deception after opening the bag."
 VIETold.0020.t:0 "An Unscrupulous Servant"
 VIETold.0020.desc:0 "I’ve received damning evidence revealing that one of my servants is one of the more well-to-do smugglers in the region. No wonder he always seems so happy and well-to-do compared to the others!"
 VIETold.0020.a:0 "What he does is none of my concern."
 VIETold.0020.b:0 "Expel him from my castle, but do no more."
 VIETold.0020.c:0 "Imprison him! He may have useful information."
 VIETold.0020.d:0 "Perhaps we can work together, he and I...."
 VIETold.0021.t:0 "A Saint's Relic?"
 VIETold.0021.desc:0 "“A true relic of the city’s patron saint! See for yourself!” The merchant smiles through his crooked teeth as he shows me the bone.\n\nAs I observe the bone, its ridges and its texture, the merchant continues, “This belonged to our saint, certainly, and I will give it to you for an affordable price.”"
 VIETold.0021.a:0 "This will impress quite a lot of people. I'll buy this holy relic!"
 VIETold.0021.b:0 "No thanks. I don't have any need for this kind of object."
 VIETold.0021.c:0 "That’s obviously a pig’s bone. What a fraud!"
 VIETold.0022.t:0 "Deceived!"
 VIETold.0022.desc:0 "I happily show everyone the relic I bought for cheap, but one of my servants, a clever and sharp old lady, laughs as she proves that it is merely a pig’s bone.\n\n"My, my," the elderly servant says. "It's a classic scam! I hope you're not going to be as gullible next time, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]!"\n\nAlas, I was deceived!"
 VIETold.0022.a:0 "Throw away that useless thing, I have no need for it now."

 VIETold.0023.t:0 "Sloth"
 VIETold.0023.desc:0 "I have felt extremely lazy as of late, never wanting to do anything. Today, I don’t feel like attending to my official duties, for instance."
 VIETold.0023.a:0 "A nap sounds good."
 VIETold.0023.b:0 "I think I’ll go eat some tasty food."
 VIETold.0023.c:0 "The work I’ve already done is good enough, anyways."
 VIETold.0023.d:0 "I’m just scared of interacting with others to be honest."
 VIETold.0024.t:0 "Overworking"
 VIETold.0024.desc:0 "I apparently fell asleep while working hard last night. Perhaps I am overworking myself too hard."
 VIETold.0024.a:0 "Maybe I should take a break..."
 VIETold.0024.b:0 "No! I am not working hard enough!"
 VIETold.0025.t:0 "Finders Keepers?"
 VIETold.0025.desc:0 "While looking for cheap merchandise at a local market fair, I notice a large coin purse lying on the ground. Nobody seemed to notice it, and whoever owns it doesn't seem to be around. I am very much tempted to take it..."
 VIETold.0025.a:0 "Yes! Free money! All mine, all mine!"
 VIETold.0025.b:0 "I should find the purse’s owner and give it back."
 VIETold.0025.c:0 "I’m too lazy to take it."
 VIETold.0025.d:0 "In the name of justice, I can’t steal this."
 VIETold.0026.t:0 "The Beggar Orphan"
 VIETold.0026.desc:0 "While browsing merchandise at a local market fair, I come across a young, sweet beggar girl. Her plight moves my heart, and I wish to help her in whatever way I can."
 VIETold.0026.a:0 "Give the lass my entire purse. She should make good use of it."
 VIETold.0026.b:0 "Let's help the girl go to an orphanage at a local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship]."
 VIETold.0026.c:0 "Hire her as a serving girl at my court. She'll be better off this way."
 VIETold.0027.t:0 "One's Image"
 VIETold.0027.desc:0 "I want to improve my image as a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] and ruler. If everyone knows me as a great ruler, it will be much easier for me to achieve my ambitions. Thus, I want to be known as a great ruler because of..."
 VIETold.0027.a:0 "My glory and honor."
 VIETold.0027.b:0 "My benevolent leadership."
 VIETold.0027.c:0 "My piety and faith."
 VIETold.0027.d:0 "The fear I strike into the hearts of my subjects and enemies!"
 VIETold.0028.t:0 "An Unjust Ruling"
 VIETold.0028.desc:0 "A silence enveloped the room when I judged the felon to death. It was a sentence I handed out on a whim, and perhaps was a bit harsh."
 VIETold.0028.a:0 "He... he did deserve it, right?"
 VIETold.0029.t:0 "Prosperous Rule"
 VIETold.0029.desc:0 "Throughout the land, the peasants are singing songs in praise of my just rule. My capable leadership has made the realm a prosperous and affluent place."
 VIETold.0029.a:0 "Good!" 
 VIETold.0029.b:0 "Justice is blind!" 
 VIETold.0030.t:0 "Calm Down?"
 VIETold.0030.desc:0 "Because of my notorious rage, no one in my court dares to criticize me for anything. At least that's what I've heard based on gossip... but is it true?"
 VIETold.0030.a:0 "I rule my realm as I please. Who cares for their opinions?"
 VIETold.0030.b:0 "A good ruler listens to others. Maybe I should control myself."
 VIETold.0030.c:0 "But... I want people to trust and love me."
 VIETold.0030.d:0 "In fact, my enemies fear me too!"
 VIETold.0031.t:0 "Patience"
 VIETold.0031.desc:0 "Being a very down to earth person, I always try to hear others’ opinions before making a decision, because..."
 VIETold.0031.a:0 "Every opinion is flawed. Might as well hear them all."
 VIETold.0031.b:0 "Everyone deserves to be heard, no matter who they are!"
 VIETold.0031.c:0 "I am such a great and unmatched ruler."
 VIETold.0032.t:0 "Green-Eyed Monster"
 VIETold.0032.desc:0 "I’ve started noticing that others are better at me than some things. This isn’t fair! I want to be as good as everyone else at everything – no, even better than everyone, rather. Why am I not the best in everything?"
 VIETold.0032.a:0 "No one cares about me."
 VIETold.0032.b:0 "I don’t try hard enough."
 VIETold.0032.c:0 "Maybe I shouldn’t worry about this."
 VIETold.0033.t:0 "The Orphan"
 VIETold.0033.desc:0 "One of my $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$, who was impoverished, had recently died, leaving behind an orphaned child. I really feel pity for the unfortunate youth, who has no family left. I’ll try to find the child a good place to live."
 VIETold.0033.a:0 "Send the child to be raised by one of my trusted $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$."
 VIETold.0033.b:0 "Bring the child to a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] to be raised by [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')]."
 VIETold.0033.c:0 "Invite the child to my court."
 VIETold.0034.t:0 "With My Bare Hands"
 VIETold.0034.desc:0 "Today while travelling in the countryside, a bandit or thug of some sort tried to ambush me, but I defeated the fool with my bare hands before my guards could capture him. He’s now sitting in my dungeon, awaiting punishment. Meanwhile, my court is praising me for my bravery."
 VIETold.0034.a:0 "Anyone could have done that."
 VIETold.0034.b:0 "All fear me! Ha ha!"
 VIETold.0034.c:0 "Spare the man and release him."
 VIETold.0034.d:0 "I will torture him personally..."
 VIETold.0035.t:0 "Peasant's Lesson"
 VIETold.0035.desc:0 "I am no better than anyone. I can always learn something from everyone – even the lowliest beggar or the most foolish imbecile have something to tell me. Today, while surveying a nearby town, one of the peasants taught me a profound lesson."
 VIETold.0035.a:0 "Humility is the only way to better understand the world, after all."
 VIETold.0036.t:0 "Desperate Enough?"
 VIETold.0036.desc:0 "An ugly wench is throwing herself at me."
 VIETold.0036.a:0 "I don’t care who, I’ll bed any young woman!"
 VIETold.0036.b:0 "Maybe I should have standards after all..."
 VIETold.0036.c:0 "I can’t see her ugliness anyways, so why not?"
 VIETold.0036.d:0 "When the lights are blown out, all women are beautiful."
 VIETold.0037.t:0 "The Maid"
 VIETold.0037.desc:0 "One of my new servants happens to be a pretty, innocent young maid, and I can’t get her off my mind. Some of the other men tell me that since I’m a strapping young man, I should accept my natural impulses, but I disagree – I’ve always tried to make sure I kept a pure mind, and I won’t yield, even now."
 VIETold.0037.a:0 "She may be pretty, but it would be a sin to defile her."
 VIETold.0037.b:0 "I can’t see her, anyways, so how can I admire her?"
 VIETold.0037.c:0 "I'm not interested in women. These must be strange idle thoughts."
 VIETold.0038.t:0 "Prude"
 VIETold.0038.desc:0 "Some people say I have the kind of attitude that prevents me from properly enjoying life, and I should stop being so prudish. Am I really a killjoy?"
 VIETold.0038.a:0 "Such people are merely fools."
 VIETold.0038.b:0 "Maybe they have a point."
 VIETold.0039.t:0 "Seeing Things"
 VIETold.0039.desc:0 "I thought I just saw an assassin lurking behind the trees over there. A weird, dark shape, behind those leaves... is that a dagger? It must be a dagger!"
 VIETold.0039.a:0 "Wait... I’m just seeing things again... I think."
 VIETold.0039.b:0 "RUN AWAY!"
 VIETold.0039.c:0 "Judging from the angle of the light, it’s just a distortion of my shadow."
 VIETold.0040.t:0 "The Incompetent Merchant"
 VIETold.0040.desc:0 "While shopping at a local fair, I realize that one of the merchants isn’t selling a lot of merchandise. After observing him for a while, I realize he is absolutely terrible at advertising his wares, and it's so frustrating to watch him that I can't help but openly criticize him for this."
 VIETold.0040.a:0 "How are you not a starving beggar already? You better improve at this."
 VIETold.0040.b:0 "I’ll buy your products for you, but try to improve yourself next time."
 VIETold.0040.c:0 "I have some suggestions on how to better advertise your goods..."

 VIETold.1001.t:0 "Onion Gift"
 VIETold.1001.desc:0 "One of my servants came back today after visiting a cousin living in a town some distance away. This cousin had kindly offered some precious onions as a gift."
 VIETold.1001.a:0 "Thank you! These would go great in soup."
 VIETold.1002.t:0 "Red and Yellow Carrots?"
 VIETold.1002.desc:0 "I met an interesting, perhaps slightly crazy traveler today. He claims to have seen red and yellow carrots in a faraway land! Ha ha! What a good joke. Everyone can see carrots are purple. Even if there were such things as red and yellow carrots, no one would want such outlandish colors for their carrots."
 VIETold.1002.a:0 "What next, orange carrots?"
 VIETold.1002.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! For much of history, the most common color of carrots was purple. Red and yellow carrots begin to appear during the medieval period, while orange carrots came about during the early modern period."
 VIETold.1003.t:0 "Their Cabbages!"
 VIETold.1003.desc:0 "One of my courtiers has lately refused to eat anything with cabbage. When questioned why, I was told: "Cabbage? Oh dear... you know it is peasant's food - it is like water to them. Why would a person of high status such as ourselves consume such a lowly, filthy plant?""
 VIETold.1003.a:0 "A good point!"
 VIETold.1003.b:0 "What an extreme attitude."
 VIETold.1003.c:0 "Let me guess - you are going to avoid water too?"
 VIETold.1004.t:0 "Hair Loss Treatment"
 VIETold.1004.desc:0 "As I get older, I'm starting to lose some hair. My doctor prescribed onions as a way to combat this problem. The medicinal properties of onion, he said, would help me on this situation."
 VIETold.1004.a:0 "My breath will smell really bad after this..."
 VIETold.1005.t:0 "Living Undead?"
 VIETold.1005.desc:0 "Rumors abound that several demons or evil spirits of some sort have recently habituated themselves near my residence. I have seen the commoners living nearby start to hang garlic on their windows in order to protect themselves."
 VIETold.1005.a:0 "I should do the same to protect myself."
 VIETold.1005.b:0 "Those gullible, superstitious fools..."
 VIETold.1006.t:0 "Greek Salad"
 VIETold.1006.desc:0 "I'm in the mood for some salad. They say it reminds one of the peaceful Greek countryside, and I feel like I need to relax after a stressful day of business. What better than a refreshing mix of fresh vegetables and mouthwatering cheese and dressing?"
 VIETold.1006.a:0 "I'll go ask my cook to prepare some salad."
 VIETold.1007.t:0 "Water Danger"
 VIETold.1007.desc:0 "I drank some water and choked on it. Thankfully a servant saved me, but my court witnessed the entire embarrassing situation."
 VIETold.1007.a:0 "A frightening experience!"
 VIETold.1008.t:0 "Aaaah..."
 VIETold.1008.desc:0 "After a stressful day, drinking some fresh, cool water is so relaxing."
 VIETold.1008.a:0 "Aaaahhh..."
 VIETold.1009.t:0 "Dry Wells"
 VIETold.1009.desc:0 "The wells used by your court for water have dried up. It is time to dig up new ones, and soon, or else everyone at the court will die of thirst!"
 VIETold.1009.a:0 "Send the men to find a new well."
 VIETold.1010.t:0 "Chicory Treatment"
 VIETold.1010.desc:0 "I tripped and fell down on the stairs! Thank heavens I'm okay - I just have a few bruises. My physician, [physician.GetTitledFirstName] said I should treat it with chicory, which I hate because of its bitter taste. Though I won't be eating it, and only applying it on the affected skin, having to deal with it is just annoying."
 VIETold.1010.a:0 "But I don't want my bruises to get worse."
 VIETold.1010.message:0 "The Chicory treatment did not help significantly"
 VIETold.1011.t:0 "Bitter Greens"
 VIETold.1011.desc:0 "Since I rule over a population traditionally inhabited by Hellenic peoples, I get to eat quite a lot of Greek food. I've found that the locals love eating khorta, or greens, a bitter mix of plants and herbs. It is extremely bitter though. I don't know if I can ever get used to it..."
 VIETold.1011.a:0 "Bitter foods can be tasty!"
 VIETold.1011.b:0 "Forget this Greek filth!"
 VIETold.1012.t:0 "Sugar Or No Sugar?"
 VIETold.1012.desc:0 "Coffee. No [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] can live without it, myself included. It is a natural part of our diet. Most drink it bitter, but some make it sweet by adding sugar."
 VIETold.1012.a:0 "I prefer my coffee bitter, as is custom."
 VIETold.1012.b:0 "Sweet coffee is better. Without it it's too bitter."
 VIETold.1013.t:0 "A Poor Purchase"
 VIETold.1013.desc:0 "Bitter! Olives can't be this bitter, who can eat them? How will anyone make olive oil? It seems the stock of olives I bought were too raw."
 VIETold.1013.a:0 "What a waste."
 VIETold.1014.t:0 "Stimulating Vegetables"
 VIETold.1014.desc:0 "I've eaten a lot of arugula lately in my salads. No wonder I've been feeling so... stimulated in certain ways. People say it's an aphrodisiac after all."
 VIETold.1014.a:0 "Good! Maybe this will last a long time..."
 VIETold.1014.b:0 "I should eat cabbages, which will calm me down."
 VIETold.1014.a.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the past, ancient and medieval learned men believed that arugula was an aphrodisiac. For instance, it is mentioned in the love poetry of Virgil and Ovid."
 VIETold.1014.b.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! During the medieval period, to counter the supposed aphrodisiac qualities of arugula, it was often mixed with cabbage, which was believed to have calming qualities."
 VIETold.1015.t:0 "I Eat My Spinach"
 VIETold.1015.desc:0 "Spinach may taste bitter, but I eat it because I've found it makes me feel healthier and stronger. (I've heard rumors of a less bitter spinach in faraway lands, though.)"
 VIETold.1015.a:0 "I'm strong to the finish because I eat my spinach!"
 VIETold.1016.t:0 "A New Fad"
 VIETold.1016.desc:0 "A new cosmetic popular among the noblewomen is made using the egg yolk of from quail eggs instead of the usual chicken eggs. But quail eggs are a rare luxury much more suited for gourmet food. Are these women truly vain?"
 VIETold.1016.a:0 "A useless product!"
 VIETold.1016.b:0 "I could've eaten those eggs..."
 VIETold.1016.c:0 "This does not concern me. The fad will pass in time."
 VIETold.1016.d:0 "I think it looks nice on me!"
 VIETold.1017.t:0 "Egged"
 VIETold.1017.desc:0 "Yesterday there was a local traditional festival that is held annually in the city. During the night, while everyone was busy celebrating, some drunk and inconsiderate revelers dared to egg the house of a merchant friend of mine!"
 VIETold.1017.a:0 "Maybe those hooligans were sent by his business rivals?"
 VIETold.1018.t:0 "Pickled Eggs Galore"

 VIETold.2000.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETold.2001.t:0 "Through the Valleys"
 VIETold.2001.desc:0 "When I fell asleep and traveled to the land of dreams, I found myself on a vast hill of the greenest grass, overlooking a great lake surrounding a mighty city. Below the hill was an ancient marble shrine, while behind me was a small cottage beside a forest, where birds whistled and the trees whispered comfort in my ear. I rested for a while before I decided to..."
 VIETold.2001.a:0 "Walk down the hill, to see the lake."
 VIETold.2001.b:0 "See the shrine to pay my respects."
 VIETold.2001.c:0 "Explore the forest."
 VIETold.2001.d:0 "Enter the cottage and relax."
 VIETold.2002.t:0 "Harvest Dawn"
 VIETold.2002.desc:0 "I emerge from my residence early in the morning to travel to an important noble's residence some distance from here. Along the way, as the sun slowly crept upwards into the sky, I pass by several villages. Peasants scatter themselves in the fields, working with their crops, though they always stop to pay their respects to me."
 VIETold.2002.a:0 "Good to see all is in order."
 VIETold.2002.b:0 "Those commoners scare me!"
 VIETold.2002.c:0 "I want to ask some of them about how things are going."
 VIETold.2003.t:0 "King and Country"
 VIETold.2003.desc:0 "I realize that there must have been many rulers who came before me, lesser lords and ladies, as well as mighty kings and queens, who once ruled this country. Many of them I will never know. Will I, too, be forgotten one day, not even a footnote in a history book nor even a faint whisper in the wind?"
 VIETold.2003.a:0 "Even if I die, what matters is if I did my duty."
 VIETold.2003.b:0 "I will do great deeds to ensure my immortality!"
 VIETold.2003.c:0 "As long as I'm happy, then I am fine with whatever happens."
 VIETold.2003.d:0 "Nothing matters in the end. Why do I even try?"
 VIETold.2004.t:0 "Wings of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
 VIETold.2004.desc:0 "I am in another dream again - this time, I am flying in the sky, looking over a realm of grassy pastures and green forests. There are so many places I can go to, yet one place calls to me, one place where I can't resist exploring:"
 VIETold.2004.a:0 "The pale, white temple to the north..."
 VIETold.2004.b:0 "The cosmopolitan trade port to the west..."
 VIETold.2004.c:0 "The mysterious, dark swamp to the south..."
 VIETold.2004.d:0 "The vast flower fields to the east..."
 VIETold.2005.t:0 "All's Well"
 VIETold.2005.desc:0 "Today was a very quiet and boring day at court. Nothing exciting happened."
 VIETold.2005.a:0 "Excitement isn't always desirable, so I'm glad."
 VIETold.2005.b:0 "I want excitement! I want to live life!"
 VIETold.2005.a.tooltip:0 "People always say they want excitement in their lives, but they should wish for good things first - after all, excitement isn't always good."
 VIETold.2005.b.tooltip:0 "Indeed, sometimes people always sit around and don't do anything with their lives. What's the purpose of living if you don't explore the world?"
 VIETold.2006.t:0 "Watchman's Ease"
 VIETold.2006.desc:0 ""Top of the morning and nothing to report," the guard told me as I made a few rounds around my garden."
 VIETold.2006.a:0 "Continue as you were."
 VIETold.2006.b:0 "Stand up straight!"
 VIETold.2006.c:0 "Why aren't you being more vigilant?"
 VIETold.2007.t:0 "Glory of Earth"
 VIETold.2007.desc:0 "There are of course always those who doubt my right to rule this land and claim I am not its rightful ruler. Yet how can I gaze upon this land of mine, and not see my connection to it? It is my realm too. I have a purpose as its master:"
 VIETold.2007.a:0 "To.... Actually, I'm not too sure what my purpose is."
 VIETold.2007.b:0 "To do with it as I please."
 VIETold.2007.c:0 "To protect and help my subjects."
 VIETold.2007.d:0 "To bring glory to my realm and dynasty."
 VIETold.2008.t:0 "Minstrel's Lament"
 VIETold.2008.desc:0 "A musician I hired for a banquet sings a rather sad song. Many in my court are moved deeply by the pathos of the story being told."
 VIETold.2008.a:0 "I, too, shed a tear."
 VIETold.2008.b:0 "I didn't find it that sad."
 VIETold.2009.t:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]'s Ascension"
 VIETold.2009.desc:0 "A physical manifestation of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] supposedly appeared in a village nearby, and blessed a few locals, before ascending into the heavens. Few of the official clergy seem to believe these peasants' claims, saying it is misunderstandings of the ignorant, but the peasants don't care and have built altars where these incidents occurred."
 VIETold.2009.a:0 "A good omen! Encourage the clergy to support the village."
 VIETold.2009.b:0 "It was clearly an illusion of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]. Repress the cult!"
 VIETold.2009.c:0 "I have no opinion on these peasants' superstitions."
 VIETold.2010.t:0 "Dusk at the Market"
 VIETold.2010.desc:0 "I rushed to the local market as the sun was setting, hoping to buy something I really wanted, but the merchant told me he had all run out of that product.\n\n"It will be a long time before I can acquire more of it," he told me apologetically.\n\nEven if I were to pay him a lot of money, he won't be able to get it for me right now."
 VIETold.2010.a:0 "No problem with that! I will wait."
 VIETold.2010.b:0 "That bastard! He's tricking me!"
 VIETold.2010.c:0 "At least he's honest. Can't do much now."
 VIETold.2011.t:0 "Sunrise of Flutes"
 VIETold.2011.desc:0 "Today I woke up earlier than usual.\n\nFeeling a bit restless, I ventured out of my residence and took a walk outside with some trusted guards.We thought we heard a whistling sound up ahead, and upon further investigation we found out that it was a young shepherd with his flock, playing a pleasant song on his wooden flute.\n\nHe greeted me reverently, and wished me the best."
 VIETold.2011.a:0 "Please, play some more music. It's good."
 VIETold.2011.b:0 "He's just a peasant."
 VIETold.2012.t:0 "Peace of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
 VIETold.2012.desc:0 "There are those who say that according to our divine scriptures, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] wants all peoples to be at peace with one another. But is that just mere idealism? Can true peace under the wisdom and benevolence of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] ever be accomplished?"
 VIETold.2012.a:0 "I think [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] wants us to smite infidels, not to have peace!"
 VIETold.2012.b:0 "Love and peace! We are indeed all brothers and sisters!"
 VIETold.2012.c:0 "It's a nice idea, but idealism can only do so much."
 VIETold.2013.t:0 "Love Under Moon"
 VIETold.2013.desc:0 "The book I read looked like a typical vapid romance at first. Instead, it was an epic love story with drama, comedy and tragedy, that raised poignant, difficult questions about human morality and mortality. Immensely moved, I now find it hard to fall asleep at night as I think about the characters I'd grown to love and their bittersweet fates. Will I ever read a story like that again?"
 VIETold.2013.a:0 "I never expected to like that kind of story in the first place!"
 VIETold.2014.t:0 "A Simple Story"
 VIETold.2014.desc:0 "I was watching a play a traveling troupe was performing. Though it was a short and simple love story without much drama or conflict, the characters were likeable and realistic in their motivations and desires. Despite its simplicity and lack of tension, many in the audience loved the story."
 VIETold.2014.a:0 "Those plebeians - it's just some banal fluff!"
 VIETold.2014.b:0 "I admit, it brought a smile to my face."
 VIETold.2015.t:0 "Bad History"
 VIETold.2015.desc:0 "A poet is reciting a tale about a historical event long ago before me and an audience. I realize he just made a mistake, and there are some inaccuracies in his retelling of what happened!\n\nPerhaps I should do my duty and inform this poet that his knowledge of the past is faulty, and will cause others to misunderstand those who came before us. On the other hand, maybe people will misinterpret my good intentions as haughtiness. What to do...?"
 VIETold.2015.a:0 "Don't say anything. I don't need people thinking I'm smug."
 VIETold.2015.b:0 "Correct him - history should not be lies!"
 VIETold.2015.c:0 "Correct him - the true history is more interesting."
 VIETold.2015.d:0 "Correct him - I want to show off my knowledge."
 VIETold.2016.t:0 "Visions of the Past"
 VIETold.2016.desc:0 "I was idly reading a book about historical events in ancient times. Suddenly, when I came across a particular section, disjointed images and scenes flashed before my mind, as if I was really there. My servants found me on the ground moments later, having fainted. They were skeptical when I described what happened, but the feelings of sadness, joy, hatred, love - I felt all that!"
 VIETold.2016.a:0 "Was I really there, in the past? Why am I here now?"
 VIETold.2017.t:0 "Deeds of Heroes"
 VIETold.2017.desc:0 "I recently took the time to read through various books explaining the exploits and deeds of ancient heroes and warriors. It was informative, and helped me to better understand:"
 VIETold.2017.a:0 "Which tactics and strategies work, and which ones don't."
 VIETold.2017.b:0 "What makes a person brave and able to fight the odds."
 VIETold.2017.c:0 "How to uphold justice and righteousness among all."
 VIETold.2018.t:0 "A Simple Love Story"
 VIETold.2018.desc:0 "I recently read a touching story about a pure-hearted romance between a young man and woman who had grown up as neighbors and friends. Their virtue and honesty helped them ensure many hardships so they could be united in marriage."
 VIETold.2018.a:0 "I hate stupid love stories. Why did I read that?"
 VIETold.2018.b:0 "It was an adorable tale about true love."
 VIETold.2019.t:0 "Outside"
 VIETold.2019.desc:0 "I sit at the windowsill, staring outside. What do I see far away that I observe with great scrutiny?"
 VIETold.2019.a:0 "Nature's somber awe - plants, the skies, the sun before me."
 VIETold.2019.b:0 "A group of peasant children playing games outside."
 VIETold.2019.c:0 "Some of my guardsmen marching around on patrol."
 VIETold.2019.d:0 "Someone very attractive passing through."
 VIETold.2020.t:0 "Stuck at Home"
 VIETold.2020.desc:0 "In my dream, I live in a large mansion of unrivaled beauty, so vast it could not have been built by mundane means. It is a gorgeous residence where I have all the comforts of home - food, drink, and entertainment at my beck and call, and all manner of exotic mechanical and magical contraptions. And yet I am trapped. Every time I try to escape, I end up coming back, somehow!"
 VIETold.2020.a:0 "This is no way to live! I must be free!"
 VIETold.2020.b:0 "Since it is here before me, I guess I can enjoy it."
 VIETold.2020.c:0 "Only fools take for granted the gifts they're given."
 VIETold.2021.t:0 "The Ghost At Home"
 VIETold.2021.desc:0 "I pass by a small ancient ruin while traveling through a village. The peasant acting as your guide tells me of a local folk legend, that centuries ago when a plague struck the area, one of the locals holed himself up in the ruin - as it was his house back then - and died there by himself when he ran out of food and drink. His lonely spirit, supposedly, still haunts the area to this day."
 VIETold.2021.a:0 "An interesting tale, I suppose!"
 VIETold.2022.t:0 "In the Way"
 VIETold.2022.desc:0 "I am pacing back and forth inside my residence, thinking about this or that, and then I accidentally bump into some of the furniture."
 VIETold.2022.a:0 "Whoops! Silly me!"
 #VIETold.2022.message:0 "You hurt yourself bumping into furniture"
 VIETold.2023.t:0 "Eek!"
 VIETold.2023.desc:0 "Some of my young maidservants screamed in terror when a mouse scurried past us one morning. The mouse was nowhere to be found after a quick search, but some of the girls are still scared and worry there may be more mice at my home."
 VIETold.2023.a:0 "Poor children. Worry not, the mouse is gone!"
 VIETold.2023.b:0 "Come on now. Grow up already, be a little brave!"
 VIETold.2023.c:0 "The mice are our brothers and sisters, we should respect them."
 VIETold.2023.d:0 "A worrisome sight! We must remain vigilant."
 VIETold.2024.t:0 "In Flagrante"
 VIETold.2024.desc:0 "I was bored at home with nothing to do one day, so I decided to take a walk around when I overheard some muffled sounds coming from a room. I snuck over and opened the door slightly, and peeked inside. One of my maids and one of my manservants were making love and in the throes of passion, oblivious to the world around them! Though young, they should know better."
 VIETold.2024.a:0 "Barge in and order them to stop doing this in public."
 VIETold.2024.b:0 "Secretly watch them eagerly but don't tell them."
 VIETold.2024.c:0 "Forget it - it is none of my business."
 VIETold.2024.d:0 "Tell them later they have my blessing to marry."
 VIETold.2025.t:0 "Boom!"
 VIETold.2025.desc:0 "A loud noise is heard outside and on instinct I rush to the window, curious. I look out and see nothing out of the ordinary."
 VIETold.2025.a:0 "Odd. Is my imagination playing tricks on me?"
 VIETold.2026.t:0 "Night Owl"
 VIETold.2026.desc:0 "I've been staying up a lot lately out of boredom."
 VIETold.2026.a:0 "It's not a healthy thing, but I can't resist."
 VIETold.2026.b:0 "I'll try to make the most of my bad habit."
 VIETold.2027.t:0 "Deviant Lands"
 VIETold.2027.desc:0 "I have heard that there are lands far away from where I live, where the practice of marriage between siblings is common and not just accepted, but actively embraced and encouraged throughout society, from the highest of royalty to the humblest of peasants. Could such communities even exist? If they did, I have yet to meet anyone from such a place in person - or at least anyone whose story I would believe."
 VIETold.2027.a:0 "If such people existed, then they're absolutely barbaric! Degenerates, all of them!"
 VIETold.2027.b:0 "Who am I to judge? Different people have different customs and traditions."
 VIETold.2027.c:0 "Thinking about them gets me all excited. #EMP Very#! excited."
 VIETold.2027.d:0 "All of these rumors are fanciful tales made up by perverts without sisters."
 VIETold.2028.t:0 "Flying Rabbits?"
 VIETold.2028.desc:0 ""Have you heard of the flying rabbits of the far north?" my servant asks me one day, while we are conversing about various matters. "Fascinating creatures! Do you think they're real?""
 VIETold.2028.a:0 "Don't be silly. Rabbits don't fly, nor live in the frozen north."
 VIETold.2028.b:0 "Who knows? It's certainly a possibility!"
 VIETold.2028.c:0 "You're confusing them with a real creature known as the..."
 VIETold.2029.t:0 "The Last Egyptians"
 VIETold.2029.desc:0 "A traveler is regaling me with a tale he heard when he was visiting a town along the Nile one day. "I was told that during Roman times, Egypt's governor sent a trusted friend and advisor as a diplomat to the southern lands of Ethiopia, but he got lost in the desert not too far from where I stayed. He finally found a large oasis, where people still behaved like the ancient Egyptians, building pyramids and worshipping ancient gods, and they had no knowledge of how the Nile had been conquered by first the Hellenes and then the Romans.""
 VIETold.2029.a:0 "That a community would keep alive such ancient customs!" 
 VIETold.2029.b:0 "I'm sure they were merely some troglodytic peasants." 
 VIETold.2029.c:0 "Would these hidden oases still be around today?" 
 VIETold.2030.t:0 "The Fabled Eastern Islands"
 VIETold.2030.desc:0 ""Ah! Let me tell you a story," the merchant says, after we finish with business. Not one to anger my jolly guest, we sit down as we feast and he tells me what he heard when he visited China not too long ago. "I was told that if one sails east, beyond even the fabled isles of Cipangu, one would eventually reach a large island ruled by towering men who ride steeds of solid gold. These people of the Sun are most intelligent and mighty and ruled by an immortal dragon.""
 VIETold.2030.a:0 "Fascinating people! Maybe one day we'll meet them."
 VIETold.2030.b:0 "I'm not convinced they exist."
 VIETold.2031.t:0 "Opposite Land"
 VIETold.2031.desc:0 "An acquaintance tells me that she heard if one digs underground deep enough, one will emerge in another world where there are people similar to ours. However, they are the opposite of us - their women are taller than their men, the men stay at home and manage domestic affairs while the women fight wars, and most scandalously, siblings can wed one another. Still, my acquaintance said she heard this land was mostly peaceful and prosperous."
 VIETold.2031.a:0 "Perhaps their strange ways are why they're prosperous and peaceful."
 VIETold.2031.b:0 "Really now! How could a society like that possibly exist?"
 VIETold.2031.c:0 "How exciting! My imagination is trying to envision such a place."
 VIETold.2032.t:0 "Tale of the Labyrinth"
 VIETold.2032.desc:0 "Someone tells me of a king in a faraway land who was cruel, yet fair in his dealings.\n\nOnce, he hired an engineer to create the largest labyrinth the world has ever known. Those guilty of the worst crimes were put in this maze of tunnels and hallways, which were filled with all manner of violent beasts, as well as dangerous booby traps that could kill a man instantly. Almost none escaped, but there were always a few who had the wits and tenacity - or perhaps the luck and blessings of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] - to find their way out, and the king granted freedom to these few for their impressive achievement."
 VIETold.2032.a:0 "Someone capable enough to escape deserves freedom, yes."
 VIETold.2032.b:0 "A strange ruler! Such unnecessary and outlandish methods."
 VIETold.2032.c:0 "I hoped his labyrinth had many of those monsters and death traps!"
 VIETold.2033.t:0 "Guardian of the Gate"
 VIETold.2033.desc:0 "I have heard rumors about a noble and valiant warrior woman in a distant land, who is immortal and stands guard over an ancient gate made of marble and obsidian. Those who best her in combat will be allowed into the gate, which is a portal to a heavenly paradise, a most peaceful and pastoral landscape one can live in with no worries nor fears.\n\nIf it did exist, could I go there?"
 VIETold.2033.a:0 "If only I could go to such a place, I'd be so happy."
 VIETold.2033.b:0 "I'm sure I could beat that woman and gain entry."
 VIETold.2033.c:0 "I don't need it. I have all I need here."
 VIETold.2034.t:0 "A Dream of Danger"
 VIETold.2034.desc:0 "I meet a local village elder, a wizened old man, who was a foolhardy adventurer in his youth. He once got lost in a great forest, and almost drowned in its swamps. Fortunately, he was rescued by a mysterious man, who was of tall and handsome appearance, and carried himself in a calm and kind yet melancholy, somber, regal manner. This man referred to himself only as a dreamer, and warned about the seductive dangers of excitement and risk.\n\nAfterwards, the old man never sought out reckless excitement again, and lived a stable, quiet, happy life back home."
 VIETold.2034.a:0 "Agreed! Only idiots blindly worship excitement and ambition."
 VIETold.2034.b:0 "I disagree. What's the point of living a boring life?"
 VIETold.2034.c:0 "Wait a moment... did you meet the #EMP Dreamer#!?"
 VIETold.2035.t:0 "The Immortal Horse"
 VIETold.2035.desc:0 "Among the nomad peoples of Eurasia, there are stories of an immortal horse, forever racing across the great steppes, free and bold. The galloping of the mighty steed's hooves sound like thunder, and it is faster than anything one could see."
 VIETold.2035.a:0 "Maybe one day I shall see it!"
 VIETold.2035.b:0 "A fanciful tale, nothing more."
 VIETold.2036.t:0 "Woman in White"
 VIETold.2036.desc:0 "I have a guard who once visited a distant village by a forest, said to be a gateway to the world beyond. While there, he went in the forest despite the locals' warning.\n\nIn the forest, he encountered a pale maiden wearing a white dress. Though she was charming and bashful, there was something off about her; the tone of her voice was odd, and her dress fluttered in the wind in a strange way.

 VIETold.2088.desc:0 "I am hearing tales of the barbarian warlords who attacked the Rome generations ago. Attila of course is the most famous, but others are also well known. Alaric the Goth sacked Rome yet died soon after, for example. These is also Genseric, who transformed the Vandals into a Mediterranean power; the ambitious Odoacer, who overthrew the last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus; and Clovis, first king of the united Franks."
 VIETold.2088.a:0 "Genseric's daring and cunning is underrated in these annals."
 VIETold.2088.a.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Though less known compared to other, more famous "barbaric" kings, Genseric impressively transformed the Vandals from a minor tribe into a major power. He reorganized their military and social structure, and developed a fleet that allowed him to conquer parts of the Mediterranean, particularly North Africa and the great city of Carthage."
 VIETold.2088.b:0 "Attila was like the coming of the apocalypse!"
 VIETold.2088.b.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The so-called "Scourge of God," Attila the Hun, was one of the most feared of Rome's enemies from late antiquity, and perhaps one of the most well-known nomadic warlords after Genghis Khan. Though the origins - and the eventual fate - of the Huns are still uncertain, they are remembered for their devastating raids on the Romans and various Germanic tribes."

 VIETold.2088.c.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Alaric actually started as one of many Germanic soldiers fighting for both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. He was likely very Romanized himself and made deals with Roman generals like the great Stilicho - in fact, after Stilicho's execution by political rivals, Alaric was declared an enemy of Rome. This would cause a chain of events leading to the sack of Rome in 410 CE, which earned him a place in history."

 VIETold.2088.d.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In 476 CE, Odoacer proclaimed himself King of Italy and overthrew the last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augstulus. Contrary to typical portrayals of the "Fall of Rome," Odoacer nominally recognized the overlordship of the Eastern Roman Empire, had support among the Roman Senatorial class, and utilized Roman administrative systems. He was eventually killed by the Ostrogothic king, Theodoric."

Strangely, last night, she visited me in a dream.\n\nI couldn't tell where we met exactly, but I recall there was some sort of brilliant light, and the feeling of a gentle breeze caressing my face. My servant said she had always loved me like her own child, but now she had to go. She embraced me, wished me the best, and said goodbye for one last time before her final journey.

I and others are by his bedside as his final hour draws near, and I ask him if he is afraid of the end.\n\n"End? No, the journey doesn't end here," he smiles gently.

Such stories have even reached my court, and in the past couple weeks, it's all anyone can talk about.\n\n[courtier.GetTitledFirstName] in particular has been enamored with these rumors. Today, [courtier.GetSheHe] can't stop talking about the latest [courtier.GetSheHe] heard about this faraway realm. "They say that here, the sun is always shining, the flowers are always blooming, fruits are always hanging from the trees, and the waters are calm and of a beautiful light blue color." [courtier.GetSheHe|U] then adds, after a wistful sigh, "It is said that if one travels far across the sea, one will eventually reach this hidden paradise, and that the natives will welcome one like kin."\n\nI have to wonder whether [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] believes any of this."
 VIETold.2248.a:0 "I am not sure whether this land exists, but it's a fun story."
 VIETold.2248.b:0 "Perhaps if we sail across the ocean, we'll reach it one day."
 VIETold.2248.c:0 "The question is whether the natives worship [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 VIETold.2249.t:0 "The Dreamers' Song"
 VIETold.2249.desc:0 "An elder traveler from [county.GetNameNoTier] named [adventurer.GetFirstName] is visiting my court today. Though an older gentle[adventurer.GetWomanMan], there is a charismatic quality to [adventurer.GetHerHim] that can only come with the wisdom and authority of old age.\n\n[adventurer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has strange but thoughtful ideas, so I enjoy talking with [adventurer.GetHerHim]. We are discussing many fascinating matters when [adventurer.GetSheHe] asks me, "Have you ever heard of Scarborough Fair?""
 VIETold.2249.a:0 "Perhaps... but... perhaps not? What do you mean?"
 VIETold.2250.t:0 "Scarborough Fair"
 VIETold.2250.desc:0 ""Scarborough is an actual place, but the song, Scarborough Fair, is a most profound ballad about human existence," [adventurer.GetFirstName] says. When I ask [adventurer.GetHerHim] to explain, [adventurer.GetSheHe] sings the song to me:\n\n#italic "Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.\nRemember me to one who lives there\nShe once was a true love of mine."#!\n\n[adventurer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] smiles and tells me, "Though it is an impossible task, we are all traveling to Scarborough Fair, dear friend. Keep in mind these words, for they are truly wise if you think about them deeply.""
 VIETold.2250.a:0 "Thank you, kind elder."
 VIETold.2250.a.tooltip:0 "#weak At the end of the road, of the journey we all must take, no matter how impossible, is Scarborough Fair....#!"
