 VIETmisc.0001.t:0 "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme"
 VIETmisc.0001.desc:0 "On the road near my residence, I came across a traveling bard who offered to sing me a song called "Scarborough Fair." I decided there was nothing to lose, and allowed this bard to sing the song. The opening lines of the song are:\n\n"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.\nRemember me to one who lives there.\nShe once was a true love of mine."\n\nIt turned out to be a truly profound and beautiful song, and brought a tear to my eye and that of my guards."
 VIETmisc.0001.a:0 "Bravo, bravo! To Scarborough Fair we go!"
 VIETmisc.0002.t:0 "The Heartland"
 VIETmisc.0002.desc:0 "In my dreams, I travel to a seemingly gorgeous, pastoral land. It is filled with meadows of the greenest grass, peaceful quiet forests and streams, and cozy cities and villages scattered all over. I end up in one of these little settlements, and spend some time there enjoying myself, getting to know the inhabitants. Where am I at, specifically?"
 VIETmisc.0002.a:0 "A small forest town located near a picturesque stream."
 VIETmisc.0002.b:0 "A hamlet where I helped a farmer fight invading monsters."

 VIETmisc.0003.desc:0 "On a visit to a nearby town, I met with a few prominent merchants. One of these merchants, a well-traveled gastronome who enjoys discovering the foods of different lands, gave me some baklava as a gift. It is a pastry from the eastern Mediterranean that is made from thin layers of dough, filled with syrup, honey, and nuts. Truly, it is one of the most delicious foods ever imagined."
 VIETmisc.0003.a:0 "Thank you! Your gift is much appreciated."
 VIETmisc.0004.t:0 "Idle Conversation"
 VIETmisc.0004.desc:0 "I am overhearing a conversation between two of my guards.\n\n"Heard any news from the other regions?"\n\n"Nothing I'd like to talk about."\n\n"I've heard others say the same."\n\n"I ran into some..."\n\nI am getting rather bored, and wonder whether I should keep listening to their chatter, which I find inane and devoid of substance."
 VIETmisc.0004.a:0 "I'll find something else to distract myself with."
 VIETmisc.0004.b:0 "I have nothing better to do, so I don't mind hearing them chat."
 VIETmisc.0005.t:0 "A Forgotten Dream?"
 VIETmisc.0005.desc:0 "I had an amazing dream last night! After I woke up, I immediately found the nearest person, one of my servants, and began to recount what happened in the dream.\n\nExcept... by that point I had forgotten what had happened in my dream. I stumbled over my words as I struggled to recall any details of my dream as my servant stood there awkwardly.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what happens in the world of dreams?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a:0 "How irritating. Oh well!"
 VIETmisc.0005.b:0 "I must remember! Why can't I? Why?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a.a:0 "You remember what the dream was about"
 VIETmisc.0005.toast.a:0 "You remembered what the dream was about"

 VIETmisc.0007.desc:0 "One of my servants recently just experienced a personal tragedy, as their beloved child died from illness. This servant is, of course, now in mourning, a look of uttermost grief on their often tear-stained face. All the other servants and even a few members of my court are doing their best to comfort this servant of mine, so perhaps I should offer at least a few kind words as well."
 VIETmisc.0007.a:0 ""I am sincerely sorry for your loss and pain that you are going through.""
 VIETmisc.0007.b:0 ""Your child is now in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm] with [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].""
 VIETmisc.0007.c:0 "Why do I need to say anything? Peasants die all the time."

 VIETmisc.0008.t:0 "Fresh Air"
 VIETmisc.0008.desc:0 "I take a quick walk outside, and the feel of the shining sun on my face is just amazing and comforting."

 VIETmisc.0009.t:0 "Ah!"
 VIETmisc.0009.desc:0 "While sitting outside, I was feeling rather thirsty and asked a servant to fetch me some water. After drinking it, I felt truly refreshed! It is amazing the effect some cool, fresh water can have on a person."
 VIETmisc.0009.a:0 "That was nice."
 VIETmisc.0010.t:0 "Numb Legs"
 VIETmisc.0010.desc:0 "While attending to chamber business, I sat on the chamber pot for too long that my legs got too numb. I'm afraid if I stand up, I might slip."

 VIETmisc.0010.b:0 "I'll be fine - ouch!"
 VIETmisc.0010.b.a:0 "You manage to stand up without any trouble"

 VIETmisc.0011.t:0 "Itchy!"
 VIETmisc.0011.desc:0 "I kept feeling itchy at a certain spot today for no reason as far as I could tell. I scratched it but the itch would come back."

 VIETmisc.0012.t:0 "Hauntings"
 VIETmisc.0012.desc:0 "There are rumors that a ghost has been haunting a part of residence for the past few days. Some servants reported seeing a strange shadow appear and disappear. However, others are convinced these are just hallucinations."
 VIETmisc.0012.a:0 "There! I just saw it! It... no, that can't have just been a shadow!"
 VIETmisc.0012.b:0 "Silly superstitions! They are just seeing things."
 VIETmisc.0012.c:0 "Can we ask a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] to say some prayers?"
 VIETmisc.0012.d:0 "I don't fear the ghosts! Let them come!"
 VIETmisc.0012.e:0 "I am sure it's nothing... right?"
 VIETmisc.0013.t:0 "A Mis-Step"
 VIETmisc.0013.desc:0 "I was walking outside in the garden with the rest of my court when my foot slipped and I nearly tumbled. Thankfully I caught my step before it was too late, but it was still embarrassing it happened in front of the whole court, as I must have looked like a fool!"
 VIETmisc.0013.a:0 "Not that big a deal, honestly."
 VIETmisc.0013.b:0 "Try to pretend it didn't happen."
 VIETmisc.0013.c:0 "Make a self-deprecating joke."
 VIETmisc.0014.t:0 "An Embarrassing Memory"
 VIETmisc.0014.desc:0 "I suddenly remembered an embarrassing memory from the past. When I think of what I did, my heart tightens and I can't help but shudder at my foolish actions or thoughts. Why did I even do that back then, and more importantly, why does my brain remind me about these things?"
 VIETmisc.0014.a:0 "Why is it invading my thoughts? Agh!"
 VIETmisc.0015.t:0 "A Happy Memory"
 VIETmisc.0015.desc:0 "I suddenly recalled a happy memory from my past. Though it happened long ago, it still brings a smile to my face."
 VIETmisc.0015.a:0 "What good times those were."
 VIETmisc.0016.t:0 "Increased Workload"
 VIETmisc.0016.desc:0 "Things have been pretty busy lately. I've been doing a lot of work, reviewing documents and signing them, thinking about what to do for my realm, and so on. It's all I ever think about. A few people have told me perhaps it is best I relax and take it easy."
 VIETmisc.0016.a:0 "I should reduce my workload."
 VIETmisc.0016.b:0 "I must continue doing my work."
 VIETmisc.0016.c:0 "What's wrong with me? I hate work! No more work!"
 VIETmisc.0017.t:0 "An Early Bird"
 VIETmisc.0017.desc:0 "By chance I woke up earlier than I usually do today and can't go back to sleep. I have some important documents to review that I could get a head start on, but on the other hand, why should I have to worry about that?"
 VIETmisc.0017.a:0 "I will relax and enjoy the morning before my official duties begin."
 VIETmisc.0017.b:0 "No, I need to be responsible and start working."
 VIETmisc.0018.t:0 "Too Late!"
 VIETmisc.0018.desc:0 "A few days ago, I was having a conversation with someone. It wasn't an intense quarrel by any means, but the discussion was a little heated at some points. The other person made a good argument that I didn't have any comeback to, even though I knew they were wrong.\n\nJust today, while I was going about my business, I finally thought of a proper counterargument I could have used in that conversation. My mind sure works in mysterious ways - why didn't I think of it sooner? If I had thought of it, I would have surely won our little debate... right? "
 VIETmisc.0018.a:0 "This is so frustrating!"
 VIETmisc.0019.t:0 "An Old Shrine"
 VIETmisc.0019.desc:0 "I paid a visit to some small ruins not too far away. Locals say many generations ago it served as a tiny [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] in the area, a place for those who truly believed in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] to worship, though others are skeptical. Regardless, I prayed there for a while."
 VIETmisc.0019.a:0 "It was a good experience."
 VIETmisc.0019.b:0 "I only did it out of courtesy and obligation."
 VIETmisc.0020.t:0 "Ha Ha!"
 VIETmisc.0020.desc:0 "I heard a great joke earlier today that made me laugh without stopping for a couple minutes, but now I can't recall it at all. This is really bothering me."
 VIETmisc.0020.a:0 "Oh well, at least I had a good laugh!"
 VIETmisc.0021.t:0 "Who's there?"
 VIETmisc.0021.desc:0 ""[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!" a voice calls from behind. "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"\n\n"Who is it?" I say loudly.\n\nSilence.\n\nHmm. Odd.\n\nI thought I heard someone calling my name. Yet, when I turned my head around, there was no one around.\n\nVery odd...."
 VIETmisc.0021.a:0 "Must have been my imagination."
 VIETmisc.0022.t:0 "A Boring Meeting"
 VIETmisc.0022.desc:0 "It was an ordinary, mundane meeting with my council. We were discussing a rather boring topic that wasn't of the utmost urgency. I looked around, seeing my councilors as they droned on and on about this or that, and wondered whether any of this was worth my attention."
 VIETmisc.0022.a:0 "Look outside the window and see what's out there."
 VIETmisc.0022.b:0 "Pretend to look like I am paying attention."
 VIETmisc.0022.c:0 "Try to focus on the discussion even if it's boring."
 VIETmisc.0023.t:0 "Got to Go, Got to Go Right Now!"
 VIETmisc.0023.desc:0 "A very important envoy from a foreign state is paying me a visit. I sit on my throne, listening to this talkative gentleman drone on, and on, and on, and on. It seems to go on forever, and I am even starting to doze off out of boredom, when I realize something alarming. Dangerous, even.\n\nI really need to go to the chamber pot.\n\nBadly.\n\nRight now.\n\nI can't hold it in, I am about to burst any moment now - what do I do?"
 VIETmisc.0023.a:0 "I must run to the chamber pot immediately!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b:0 "I must... hold it in... NO!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b.a:0 "You manage to hold in your bladder"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success.title:0 "Your successfully held your bladder in!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success:0 "After the envoy leaves, you immediately sprint to the chamber pot."
 VIETmisc.0023.b.b:0 "You fail to hold in your bladder"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure.title:0 "You couldn't hold your bladder in!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure:0 "You have an accident in front of the envoy. Embarrassing, yet preventable - why didn't you listen to your body's natural instincts to run to the chamber pot?"
 VIETmisc.0024.t:0 "Unfortunate Flower"
 VIETmisc.0024.desc:0 "While taking a walk outside I found a very beautiful flower. However, as I went over to take a closer look at it, potentially to pick it up and keep it, I misstepped and accidentally stomped on it."
 VIETmisc.0024.a:0 "Oh well, it can't be helped!"
 VIETmisc.0024.b:0 "No! I wanted that flower! Dammit!"
 VIETmisc.0025.t:0 "Cool Breeze"
 VIETmisc.0025.desc:0 "I'm standing outside when I feel the gentle breeze against my face. It feels so refreshing, so relaxing."
 VIETmisc.0025.a:0 "Moments like these make life worth living."
 VIETmisc.0026.t:0 "Missing Document"
 VIETmisc.0026.desc:0 "I came to my desk this morning to wrap up some important paperwork. I searched for the last document I needed to finish, yet I couldn't find it! In a panic, I searched the whole room for what must have been a couple hours. Finally, I found it when I realized I put it in one of my books as a bookmark. My little crisis is averted, but that definitely made me tense and anxious for a while."
 VIETmisc.0026.a.a:0 "You successfully relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.toast.a:0 "You successfully relaxed"
 VIETmisc.0026.a.b:0 "You fail to relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.toast.b:0 "You failed to relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.a:0 "I need to take a deep breath and relax."
 VIETmisc.0027.t:0 "Executing the Psychopath"
 VIETmisc.0027.desc:0 "A murderer was recently caught. His crimes were quite heinous, not to mention he showed no remorse, and said he felt delight at inflicting pain on others. There was little debate on what needed to be done. He was duly sentenced to die a horrible slow execution, and today my court and I got to witness this gory spectacle. Everyone is talking about how such a monster could even exist! What are my thoughts on the matter?"
 VIETmisc.0027.a:0 "Yes, I agree it is tragic that such people exist in this world!"
 VIETmisc.0027.b:0 "I don't care, to be honest, but I have to keep appearances."
 VIETmisc.0027.c:0 "Pity, my army could use another bloodthirsty psychopath."
 VIETmisc.0028.t:0 "Age of Empires"
 VIETmisc.0028.desc:0 "In antiquity, the Romans were one of the greatest empires the world had ever seen. Still, there were other powerful states as well from that ancient time. I am reading stories about the deeds and exploits of other great empires from then, and one in particular inspires me."
 VIETmisc.0028.a:0 "Ashoka of the Mauryans ushered in an era of peace for all India."
 VIETmisc.0028.b:0 "Alexander the Great led the Greeks to the ends of the earth."

 VIETmisc.0029.desc:0 "I was out and about when I noticed something shiny on the ground.\n\nCurious, I went closer to investigate. To my surprise, it turned out to be one very shiny gold coin. Did someone drop it here by accident? Who knows.\n\nThere doesn't look to be anyone around, so it looks like this coin belongs to me now."
 VIETmisc.0029.a:0 "It is very shiny indeed." 
 VIETmisc.0030.t:0 "Careful, Now"
 VIETmisc.0030.desc:0 ""It's been an honor to meet. Thank you for your hospitality, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].... Until we meet again." The foreign envoy bows to me in respect, and is about to leave.\n\nI stand up to say farewell, but stumble out of my chair and clumsily fall on the ground.\n\nThankfully I did not hurt myself, but that was still embarrassing!"
 VIETmisc.0030.a:0 "At least the envoy was polite about it."
 VIETmisc.0031.t:0 "Good Dream"
 VIETmisc.0031.desc:0 "I had a dream where I came into a realm of light, and nothing but light. Light was everywhere, and all I could see. Yet this did not frighten me - if anything, I felt at peace with the cosmos.\n\nAfter I woke up, the feeling of serenity stayed with me for the rest of the day."
 VIETmisc.0031.a:0 "Surely this is a sign from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 VIETmisc.0031.b:0 "I feel invigorated and at ease."
 VIETmisc.0032.t:0 "Bad Dream"
 VIETmisc.0032.desc:0 "I had a dream where I was in a realm of darkness, and nothing but darkness. I could not see anything, and though there was nothing explicitly threatening me, I could not help but feel a great sense of dread.\n\nAfter I woke up, these feelings of dread continued for the rest of the day."
 VIETmisc.0032.a:0 "Is [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] warning me? Or showing disapproval?"
 VIETmisc.0032.b:0 "I feel uneasy about everything now."
 VIETmisc.0033.t:0 "Challenging Reading"
 VIETmisc.0033.desc:0 "The book I'm reading is very difficult, and its deeper meanings continue to elude me. Learned men say even the wisest among them still have trouble at times reading this book. And yet, it is said to contain great wisdoms to learn from if you can understand it. Should I persevere to try to continue reading through this, or should I give up?"
 VIETmisc.0033.a:0 "This book is not worth my energy."
 VIETmisc.0033.b:0 "I must try no matter what!"

 VIETmisc.0034.a:0 "That cloud looks like a sign from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 VIETmisc.0034.b:0 "That cloud looks like a powerful, majestic person... like me."

 VIETmisc.0035.t:0 "Itching Ahead"
 VIETmisc.0035.desc:0 "I am at a meeting with several notables of my realm, discussing important business pertaining to managing my domain, when I start to feel it. My head... itchy!\n\nI scratch my head slightly but discretely, thinking that would've taken care of it, but I was mistaken! My head is even itchier now, and I want to scratch it so badly even if I'll look like a crazed monkey in front of these people. Aagh!"
 VIETmisc.0035.a:0 "I don't care! My head is too itchy! I'll scratch it to hell!"

 VIETmisc.0036.t:0 "Eating Too Fast"
 VIETmisc.0036.desc:0 "At dinner today, I was too eager to eat and burnt my tongue when I tried to get started on the soup. Everyone in the room looked at me, either in alarm or shaking their heads at my folly."
 VIETmisc.0036.a:0 "Embarrassing! I couldn't look at others in the eye."
 VIETmisc.0036.b:0 "Happens to the best of us! We laughed it off."
 VIETmisc.0037.t:0 "A Nosy Problem"
 VIETmisc.0037.desc:0 "While relaxing in my courtyard, I notice one of my young maidservants trying to discreetly pick her nose. To be fair to her, she is very discreet about it, and no one else noticed. On the other hand, it is a rather rude thing to do, and as she's still somewhat young, perhaps she needs to learn proper manners."
 VIETmisc.0037.a:0 "I'm sure she didn't mean to, something must have clogged up her nose."
 VIETmisc.0037.b:0 "I'll approach her in secret later to gently reprimand her about this."
 VIETmisc.0037.c:0 "Ha! I'll mock her in front of everyone to teach her a lesson."
 VIETmisc.0037.d:0 "How dare she! Give her some lashings. That ought to do it."
 VIETmisc.0038.t:0 "The Purpose of Storytelling"
 VIETmisc.0038.desc:0 "I overhear two of my servants arguing about a play they recently attended. I happen to have seen this play too, and listen carefully to hear their discussion.\n\n"You actually like it? The story's terrible and silly!" the portly maid says. "It only appeals to those without taste."\n\n"You are wrong there," the tall, thin manservant counters. "It"s precisely meant to be mindless entertainment. Sometimes, we need stories that are light-hearted - who wants to deal with serious, sad tales all the time?"\n\nPerhaps I should intervene in their debate?"
 VIETmisc.0038.a:0 "No, I've no interest in this topic."
 VIETmisc.0038.b:0 "I agree with the maid - that play was complete garbage."
 VIETmisc.0038.c:0 "The manservant is right. It wasn't quality, but it made me laugh."
 VIETmisc.0038.d:0 "Both of you bring up good points, to be honest."

 VIETmisc.0039.desc:0 "I am attending the wedding of two local nobles. The groom and bride are close, as they had known each other since they were children, and they get along with each other splendidly, much to the relief of the parents. Everyone believes this marriage will be a very successful one."
 VIETmisc.0039.a:0 "I think so too. The couple look blissfully happy."
 VIETmisc.0039.b:0 "Come on. Every marriage eventually devolves into arguments and cheating."
 VIETmisc.0039.c:0 "I don't care about it as much as all the delicious food here!"
 VIETmisc.0039.d:0 "Too many people here - I think I'll just go sit in the corner."

 VIETmisc.0040.desc:0 ""It's going to be alright, things will always get better," my nanny used to tell me when I was a child and feeling scared or frustrated.\n\nI've been thinking about those words a lot lately, especially when I'm dealing with a lot of things on my mind. But now, my nanny is no longer here to comfort me.\n\nI have to wonder whether things will be alright in the end."
 VIETmisc.0040.a:0 "Of course it will be! It has to be...."
 VIETmisc.0040.b:0 "Life is different when you're no longer a child, alas."
 VIETmisc.0041.t:0 "Bump!"
 VIETmisc.0041.desc:0 "While we were taking a walk in the garden outside, [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetTitledFirstName] slipped and bumped into me! No one was hurt, nor did anyone fall down, but it was a rather embarrassing affair and [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetSheHe] looks quite sheepish for [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetHerHis] accidental disrespect towards me."
 VIETmisc.0041.a:0 "It's fine! I should have been careful too."
 VIETmisc.0041.b:0 "How dare you, you knave!"
 VIETmisc.0042.t:0 "A Problem"
 VIETmisc.0042.desc:0 "Today, I am meeting with a visitor from one of the powerful local clans who have great influence over a small but important part of my realm. I met this person the other day, when we got to know each other formally. This meeting will clearly be crucial, as I hope to discuss a number of things concerning the realm's business with my esteemed guest.\n\nI now see my guest, and hurry over. As I am about to say my greetings, however, something unimaginably terrible happens!"
 VIETmisc.0042.a:0 "Oh no! What do I do now?"

No, it couldn't have been... or maybe it was....\n\nI force a smile to buy myself time as my brain scrambles to remember their name.\n\nWhat do I do? I only have a few more moments to say something before this gets too awkward."
 VIETmisc.0043.a:0 "I'll just have to guess their name!"
 VIETmisc.0043.b:0 "I'll skillfully speak in a way that avoids their name, awkward as it may be."

 VIETmisc.0044.desc.1:0 "Lately, rumors are circulating about how I had an amorous encounter with one of the peasants in a nearby village that resulted in a child. This is, of course, completely foolish."

Now, I want nothing better than to curl up on my bed and read it. But should I waste my time getting lost in a good book, or should I moderate myself so I'll still have time for my other duties?"
 VIETmisc.0047.a:0 "I don’t worry about the rest of the world when I have stories like these!"
 VIETmisc.0047.b:0 "It'd be bad if I lost myself in my hobbies, as I have work to do."
 VIETmisc.0048.t:0 "Melodramatic"
 VIETmisc.0048.desc:0 "I am watching a play being performed by a troupe of traveling actors. The quality of their acting is… bad, and that's an understatement. The main problem is that they are overly melodramatic when they act, so none of their characters or storylines seem believable.\n\nWhen the play is finished, the response from the audience is anemic at best. It seems most people don’t like their acting either, and I'm surprised no one was booing them off stage - the acting troupe is definitely lucky in that regard! How do they even survive?"
 VIETmisc.0048.a:0 "What a waste of an afternoon!"
 VIETmisc.0048.b:0 "I'll give them some money out of pity."

It seems these hooligans wanted to cause trouble, as they weren't thieves looking to steal priceless spiritual artifacts. Either way, they managed to escape before the guards could catch them, and we have no idea who they are.\n\nRegardless, while the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] didn’t suffer extensive damage, it is seeking any help in rebuilding."

 VIETmisc.0050.desc:0 "A famous painter lives not too far from where I live. I paid him a visit to see what his latest works of art were.\n\nTo my surprise, it seems like he is experimenting with some rather unusual ideas - depictions of strange if not horrifying otherworldly creatures, unorthodox mixtures of colors and shapes, concepts not seen elsewhere, and more. Yet I can't deny these odd experiments in art have their charm."

 VIETmisc.0051.desc:0 "While on the road to take care of some business, we stopped at an ancient ruin to rest. The ruin is relatively small in size and doesn't cover a large area, and not much remains.\n\nI stroll around it for a bit and examine its walls, which appear to have some kinds of artwork or carvings. Most of it is too weathered away for me to figure out what it depicts, but it does remind me that this place must have used to look gorgeous back in the day."
 VIETmisc.0051.a:0 "Whatever the case, I should rest a bit before I continue my journey."
 VIETmisc.0052.t:0 "Almost Too Real"
 VIETmisc.0052.desc:0 "While visiting a local nobleman, he shows us one of his prized possessions: a painting he acquired sometime ago that depicts a beautiful woman. Now, paintings about people are nothing out of the ordinary, but this painting in particular is famous because the artist managed to do an extremely realistic depiction of a person - so real, that it almost feels as if that the painting looks as if it is a real, living, breathing lady, who at any moment will jump out the frame and interact with us."
 VIETmisc.0052.a:0 "A most impressive work of art!"

 VIETmisc.0053.desc:0 "A play is being performed for me and my court.\n\nThis one has an interesting and dramatic story, as it involves relations between a brother and a sister who do not know they are related and fall in love. It is only after they consummate their love, marry, and have children that they tragically learn the truth. Their community ostracizes them, and unable to come to terms with their actions they commit suicide at the end of the story.\n\nTruly a sad tale, full of twists and turns! Everyone agrees it was a riveting performance."
 VIETmisc.0053.a:0 "Ah! What irony! What drama! What pathos! What tragedy!"
 VIETmisc.0053.b:0 "Disgusting - we are not here to watch this kind of perversion!"
 VIETmisc.0053.c:0 "To be honest I found it boring. Drama plays can be too much sometimes."

While it is not the largest house of worship, whoever built and decorated it was very clever with the limited resources they had. The artwork is sublime, the walls a pleasant glowing color, and sunlight filters through the windows from outside in such a way that it literally looks like there is a stairway to the heavens!"
 VIETmisc.0054.a:0 "This shows the indomitable strength of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] way."

Despite his nervousness, he performs splendidly for the most part, and everyone is impressed with the eloquence of his words and the way he expresses emotion.\n\nAlas, right in the middle of reciting his poetry, the poor man forgets the lines of his poem! His mouth opens slightly, his eyes pop out as he goes into a panic. He stutters the previous lines, in an attempt to remember. Meanwhile, everyone is watching awkwardly."

 VIETmisc.0056.desc:0 "I'm at a local tavern, enjoying some good food and some good music. The music, in particular, is being played by a veteran bard, who plays the lute as beautifully as he sings.\n\nIn the middle of his performance, however, tragedy strikes! The strings on his lute snap, and he is bereft of an instrument to play! He looks heartbroken as he stares in shock at the remains of his lute."
 VIETmisc.0056.a:0 "Well, I suppose there’s not much any of us can do about it."
 VIETmisc.0056.b:0 "Ha! How pathetic! How this is real entertainment!"
 VIETmisc.0056.c:0 "It’s alright, I'll buy him a drink and give him money for a new lute."
 VIETmisc.0057.t:0 "Repent!"
 VIETmisc.0057.desc:0 "Today while in town, I see a crowd gathered around a traveling [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] delivering a fiery sermon. He rants about people's sins, and how many of us will go to hell if we don't repent and listen to the true and noble [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings. Most people aren't listening to his noisy ramblings too closely, and appear to be more amused by his antics more than anything."
 VIETmisc.0057.a:0 "The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] is right. Do they wish to go to hell? Repent! Repent now!"
 VIETmisc.0057.b:0 "As long as we do the right thing and trust in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] we will be fine."

 VIETmisc.0058.desc:0 "Last night I had a terrifying dream. Demons in service to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName] came and took me into some sort of room, where all sorts of gory and horrifying spectacles could be seen. They tied me up to some burning metal rod, and were about to start torturing me until I woke up, screaming.\n\nA terrifying experience, all in all, but thank goodness it was just a dream… right?"
 VIETmisc.0058.a:0 "I'm sure it was just a coincidence."
 VIETmisc.0058.b:0 "This is a lesson for me to be a more faithful [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] follower."
 VIETmisc.0059.t:0 "Gate of Hell"
 VIETmisc.0059.desc:0 "In the village I am visiting, I hear one of the elders tell me of a strange event that happened when she was a little girl.\n\nBack then, a giant hole appeared out of nowhere, causing a lot damage. The villagers were convinced it was the gateway to hell. They tried many different ways of dealing with it, such as tossing entire cows down the hole, and then a lot of dirt. Eventually something must have worked as the hole closed up.\n\nTo this day, no one is certain for sure what caused it, and all that remains is a small hollow in the land."
 VIETmisc.0059.a:0 "All's well that ends well, I suppose?"
 VIETmisc.0060.t:0 "A Changed Woman"
 VIETmisc.0060.desc:0 "Today I met an old village elder in my realm. As a young woman, she wickedly partook in all manner of sin, so she claims (the other elderly villagers told me later she was more a troublemaker than a genuine evildoer).\n\nHowever, one year, she fell ill with fever, and hovered between life and death for a year, so she claims (the other elderly villagers told me it was actually a month). During this time, she dreamt of visiting hell, and saw many terrifying visions.\n\nAfter she recovered, she realized she was given a second chance, and reformed to live a good, virtuous life, so she claims (the other elderly villagers say that part is true)."
 VIETmisc.0060.a:0 "Whether it’s true or not, her story is a very interesting one."
 VIETmisc.0060.b:0 "The elder’s story is inspiring! Faith in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] saves us."

Now, [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetSheHe] is convinced [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] friend is visiting [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHim] from hell to warn [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHim] about the consequences of [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] vices.\n\nThen again, none of [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] servants could verify reports of this ghost."

Some say that parts of hell are very hot and fiery, where you're in great pain from the heat and constantly burning. Other parts meanwhile are freezing cold, and your limbs grow numb with pain as you freeze to death again and again. I have to wonder whether a hot hell or a cold hell is preferable.""
 VIETmisc.0062.a:0 "The hot hell, as I can stand heat but not freezing temperatures."
 VIETmisc.0062.b:0 "The cold hell sounds less painful - relatively speaking."

I saw it with my own eyes.”\n\n“Our friend here is exaggerating,” the scholar says, “such things are unlikely.”\n\n“Are you really going to listen to this armchair bookworm?

Almshouses would typically provide shelter and food to the poor, old, and ill."

They all began to dance - quietly, mysteriously, and, somehow, beautifully in an eerie way.\n\nI counted exactly one hundred people as I wandered this crowd. When I came to the last person, he told me in a pleasant but tired voice (as he slowly danced around me), "Thank you for hosting us. We are a hundred spirits. We will not cause any trouble."\n\nI woke up early in the morning, and, on instinct, I walked over to my window.

Though eerie, he spoke in a polite and calm manner: “I know I'm dead but I don't want to lie in a grave out here where the wolves cry. Lift me up, out of here my friend, so I'll wander the night 'til the ages end.” When he waved farewell, his hand turned skeletal.\n\nThe meaning of the dream is clear.

Despite his obese appearance, he seems to be rather worldly and wise, as he has apparently traveled quite a lot.\n\n“As a young man, back when my body was more robust and strapping,” he continues with a sigh, “I once served as an assistant to another merchant, and we were sailing the open seas when we got caught in a most violent tempest.

Nonetheless, for whatever reason, the camels at some point learned to swim to adapt to the watery environment here, and local legends claim they even came from the sea. At present, their numbers are under threat by increased development and salt companies in the area, that block tidal waters and thus dry up the mangroves essential for this breed’s survival."

Regardless, it appears the source for this belief originated from the historical usage of asphalt or bitumen in a medicinal context, which in the Middle East was known as #italic mumiya#!, and the fact that bitumen was used to embalm mummies. Through a game of telephone of sorts during the medieval period, some came to believe that the mummies themselves - and not just bitumen - had medicinal properties."

I realized this was an unusual creature, so I brought the scroll to my window to let it free, yet it didn't budge. It took me a moment before I had an epiphany: I wasn't showing proper respect.\n\nI then donned fine robes, and bowed deeply to the creature, before taking the scroll back outside. This time, creature grew and took the shape of a dragon, before flying off with a roar.\n\nI excitedly called over [courtier.GetFirstName], who was in the next room, and told [courtier.GetHerHim] what I just witnessed. When [courtier.GetSheHe] looked at me quizzically and said, “Weren’t you sleeping just now?”.\n\nI then pointed at the slimy trail on my scroll, which led to a box holding several of my books."
 VIETmisc.0393.a:0 "It was a real dragon, I'm sure of it!"
 VIETmisc.0393.b:0 "A dream to remind me to be respectful to all?"
 VIETmisc.0393.info:0 "$VIETmisc.liaozhai_zhiyi.intro$ This tale, like a number of others from the collection, describes in a few paragraphs a brief encounter that a scholar has with some otherworldly phenomena. The story suggests that the strange dragon came from the scholar’s books, thus showing the power of literature, one which is literally magical in this story at least."
 VIETmisc.0394.t:0 "Sheep Skin" # Original Chinese: 某公
 VIETmisc.0394.desc:0 "[courtier.GetTitledFirstName] always had a tiny patch of hair on [courtier.GetHerHis] [courtier.Custom('GetRandomBodyPart')] of unusual shape. When asked about it, [courtier.GetSheHe] tells the same story about how [courtier.GetSheHe] could recall [courtier.GetHerHis] past life when [courtier.GetSheHe] was a dissolute scholar.\n\nAfter [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] died, [courtier.GetSheHe] remembers being taken to the underworld court, and was sentenced to be reborn as a sheep for [courtier.GetHerHis] sins. Yet, as demon-officials forced [courtier.GetHerHim] into a sheep skin, a demon-clerk discovered paper records proving [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] saved someone’s life, so [courtier.GetSheHe] was allowed to be reborn as a human. However, the demon-officials couldn’t remove all of the sheep skin off [courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], resulting in [courtier.GetHerHis] strange patch of hair that could never be removed."
 VIETmisc.0394.a:0 "It’s a preposterous but funny story."
 VIETmisc.0394.b:0 "A great lesson about the power of good deeds."
 VIETmisc.0394.info:0 "$VIETmisc.liaozhai_zhiyi.intro$ This tale is based on a common belief among East Asians that upon death, a person goes to the courts of hell where underworld officials, in a highly bureaucratized procedure, judge their merits or demerits in life before deciding what they will be reborn as."

 VIETmisc.0005.desc.norse:0 "Sweet Njörun! What a dream! Excited, I leap out of my bed to share its contents with someone. Anyone! I see one of my thralls, still embraced by slumber, on the earthen floor of my longhouse. I nudge him with my foot and he rises; now standing and attentive.\n\nExcept... I have forgotten what had happened in my dream. I stumble over my words; struggling to recall any detail.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what happens in the world of dreams?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a.norse:0 "Loki! He steals even my dreams. Oh well..."
 VIETmisc.0007.desc.t:0 "A Parent in Mourning"
 VIETmisc.0007.desc.norse:0 "One of my thralls was recently struck by tragedy when his only child was afflicted with sott. Hel's grasp was firm, as she quickly pulled the young girl to rest in the depths of Niflheim. Efforts made by other thralls to soothe the grieving father have proven ineffective. Even some of my own courtiers make attempts, but fail to assuage the man. Perhaps I should offer a few kind words as well."
 VIETmisc.0007.c.norse:0 "I need not say anything. Both man and child are but thralls."
 VIETmisc.0007.d.norse:0 "I will give this thrall a few days respite to pray to Eir for healing."
 VIETmisc.0010.t.norse:0 "The Yard House"
 VIETmisc.0010.desc.norse:0 "While attending to yard house business, my thoughts drifted from legal matters of the Hird to mundane matters of the home. I must have lost track of time while squatting in the garðhús, because after wiping my underside with wool, I realized I could no longer feel my legs. The numbness is so great, that I fear if I try and stand on my own, I could fall and injure myself."
 VIETmisc.0010.a.norse:0 "Where are my thralls? Help!"
 VIETmisc.0010.b.norse:0 "I can do this. If I just lean this way..."
 VIETmisc.0010.b.a.norse:0 "You manage to stand up in the yard house without any trouble"
 VIETmisc.0010.toast.b.fall.norse:0 "It appears you did not need your thralls' help after all"
 VIETmisc.0010.b.b.norse:0 "You fall forward, injuring your head on the pine barrier."
 VIETmisc.0010.toast.b.norse:0 "You injure yourself, you fool!"
 VIETmisc.0012.desc.norse:0 "There are rumors that a Draugr has been haunting a longhouse for the past few days. Some Thralls reported seeing the form of a man, known to be long dead, shuffling around the residence. While some believe he is here because his burial mound was disturbed by local children, others dismiss it as heimskur - complete nonsense."
 VIETmisc.0012.a.norse:0 "We need to check his mound. A draugr is nothing to trifle with."
 VIETmisc.0012.b.norse:0 "Heimskur, indeed. A children's story fit for children only."
 VIETmisc.0012.d.norse:0 "I fear no man nor draugr. I shall send it back to Hel!"
 VIETmisc.0018.t.norse:0 "Mimir's Late Visit"
 VIETmisc.0018.desc.norse:0 "A few days ago, I had an intense conversation with a member of my Hird. In a rare turn of events, they bested me with a clever insult. A slight, to which, I had no response.\n\nJust today, while reviewing military reports, an ingenious reply suddenly occurred to me. Curse you Mimir! You may be the wisest of all the gods, but your aid comes far too late."
 VIETmisc.0018.a.norse:0 "Why does Mimir torture me so!"
 VIETmisc.0020.t.norse:0 "A Great Jól!"
 VIETmisc.0020.desc.norse:0 "I heard a great joke earlier today. One so good that it made me double over with laughter; dropping my skål of rømmegrøt in the process. When the bowl of porridge struck the ground, it sprayed thick cream onto the front of my courtier's trousers. This somehow enhanced the joke's effectiveness, but I now can't remember the joke."
 VIETmisc.0020.a.norse:0 "No matter. The laughter echoes still, and won't be forgotten!"
 VIETmisc.0022.t.norse:0 "And Another þing"
 VIETmisc.0022.desc.norse:0 "Another sunset, another assembly upon the burial mounds of my ancestors. The Karls petitioned, then argued, points of little consequence. Topics ranged from the mundane to the petty, as they often do. Even my most trusted councilors engaged in long-winded debates unworthy of my attention. This þing...this gathering of free men, is at the heart of how we maintain order. An ancient tradition, of which I'm sure, was borne to see me suffer."
 VIETmisc.0023.t.norse:0 "Got to Go, Got to Go Right Now!"
 VIETmisc.0023.desc.norse:0 "An important foreign envoy sits in the meeting hall of my longhouse conveying his lord's message. I shift in the high seat, listening to this talkative diplomat aimlessly drift from topic to topic.\n\n"Eggs have been laid and hatched in the time this man has occupied", I think to myself when a sudden bubbling occurs in my gut. I attempt to ignore it, but the bubbling intensifies; punctuated by sharp, soul-deadening pain. If I excuse myself now, I risk insulting this important guest. If I stay, I am sure to stain more than my reputation. A decision must be made...immediately!"
 VIETmisc.0023.a.norse:0 "To the garðhús!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b.norse:0 "I must...control my... NO!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b.a.norse:0 "You manage to control your bowels."
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success.title.norse:0 "Your bowels maintain discipline!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success.norse:0 "After the envoy leaves, you sprint to the yard house."
 VIETmisc.0023.b.b.norse:0 "Your bowels fail you."
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure.title.norse:0 "You've stained your trousers...and your honor!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure.norse:0 "You relieve yourself in view of the envoy. Embarrassing, yet preventable."
 VIETmisc.0027.desc.norse:0 "A murderer was brought to justice today. Surviving witnesses stated that he perpetrated the heinous crimes with delight. As the shackled man heard the charges leveled against him, he smiled and winked at those gathered for his trial. There was little debate as to what was to be done. The killer was duly sentenced to suffer a slow execution by our elected law giver. I confirmed the order, to which a few Huscarls prepared the man for the "Blood Eagle". The criminal had his back sliced open and his ribs and lungs removed while he still drew breath. As I was returning home, a councilor asks for my opinion on the manner of execution that was chosen."
 VIETmisc.0027.a.norse:0 "A fitting sacrifice to Odin."
 VIETmisc.0039.desc.norse:0 "I am in attendance of the union between a Jarl and a Karl. It is said that the pair have known each other since childhood; and seldom seen apart throughout.\n\nThe parents believe this coupling to have been destined by the gods. And despite the formal arrangement, many expect a successful life-long commitment between bride and groom."
 VIETmisc.0039.e.norse:0 "The thrall preparing mead, eyes me. I'll ensure nothing is left to imagination!"
